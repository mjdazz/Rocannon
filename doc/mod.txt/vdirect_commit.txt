SYNOPSIS                   *vdirect_commit*

     • Commits pending configuration changes on one or more Radware devices via vDirect server.
     • For Alteon ADC device, apply, sync and save actions will be performed by default. Skipping of an action is possible by explicit parameter specifying.
     • For Alteon VX Container device, no sync operation will be performed since sync action is only relevant for Alteon ADC devices.
     • For DefensePro and AppWall devices, a bulk commit action will be performed. Explicit apply, sync and save actions specifying is not relevant.
