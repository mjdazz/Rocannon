NOTES                   *ovirt_quota-notes*

   Note

     • In order to use this module you have to install oVirt Python SDK. To ensure it’s installed with correct version you can create the following task: pip: name=ovirt-engine-sdk-python
       version=4.3.0

EXAMPLES                   *ovirt_quota-examples*

 # Examples don't contain auth parameter for simplicity,
 # look at ovirt_auth module to see how to reuse authentication:

 # Add cluster quota to cluster cluster1 with memory limit 20GiB and CPU limit to 10:
 - ovirt_quota:
     name: quota1
     data_center: dcX
     clusters:
         - name: cluster1
           memory: 20
           cpu: 10

 # Add cluster quota to all clusters with memory limit 30GiB and CPU limit to 15:
 - ovirt_quota:
     name: quota2
     data_center: dcX
     clusters:
         - memory: 30
           cpu: 15

 # Add storage quota to storage data1 with size limit to 100GiB
 - ovirt_quota:
     name: quota3
     data_center: dcX
     storage_grace: 40
     storage_threshold: 60
     storages:
         - name: data1
           size: 100

 # Remove quota quota1 (Note the quota must not be assigned to any VM/disk):
 - ovirt_quota:
     state: absent
     data_center: dcX
     name: quota1

 # Change Quota Name
 - ovirt_quota:
     id: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
     name: "new_quota_name"
     data_center: dcX
