NOTES                   *supervisorctl-notes*

   Note

     • When state = present, the module will call supervisorctl reread then supervisorctl add if the program/group does not exist.
     • When state = restarted, the module will call supervisorctl update then call supervisorctl restart.
     • When state = absent, the module will call supervisorctl reread then supervisorctl remove to remove the target program/group.

EXAMPLES                   *supervisorctl-examples*

 # Manage the state of program to be in 'started' state.
 - supervisorctl:
     name: my_app
     state: started

 # Manage the state of program group to be in 'started' state.
 - supervisorctl:
     name: 'my_apps:'
     state: started

 # Restart my_app, reading supervisorctl configuration from a specified file.
 - supervisorctl:
     name: my_app
     state: restarted
     config: /var/opt/my_project/supervisord.conf

 # Restart my_app, connecting to supervisord with credentials and server URL.
 - supervisorctl:
     name: my_app
     state: restarted
     username: test
     password: testpass
     server_url: http://localhost:9001

 # Send a signal to my_app via supervisorctl
