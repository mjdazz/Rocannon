SYNOPSIS                   *ordnance_config*

     • Ordnance router configurations use a simple block indent file syntax for segmenting configuration into sections. This module provides an implementation for working with these configuration
       sections in a deterministic way.

PARAMETERS                   *ordnance_config-parameters*

        Parameter      Choices/Defaults                                                                           Comments
   after                                The ordered set of commands to append to the end of the command stack if a change needs to be made. Just like with before this allows the playbook designer
   -                                    to append a set of commands to be executed after the command set.
   backup                Choices:       This argument will cause the module to create a full backup of the current running-config from the remote device before any changes are made. The backup file
   boolean               • no ←         is written to the backup folder in the playbook root directory. If the directory does not exist, it is created.
                         • yes
   before                               The ordered set of commands to push on to the command stack if a change needs to be made. This allows the playbook designer the opportunity to perform
   -                                    configuration commands prior to pushing any changes without affecting how the set of commands are matched against the system.
   config                               The config argument allows the playbook designer to supply the base configuration to be used to validate configuration changes necessary. If this argument is
   -                                    provided, the module will not download the running-config from the remote node.
   defaults              Choices:       This argument specifies whether or not to collect all defaults when getting the remote device running config. When enabled, the module will get the current
   boolean               • no ←         config by issuing the command show running-config all.
                         • yes
   lines                                The ordered set of commands that should be configured in the section. The commands must be the exact same commands as found in the device running-config. Be
   -                                    sure to note the configuration command syntax as some commands are automatically modified by the device config parser.
                                        aliases: commands
                         Choices:
   match                 • line ←       Instructs the module on the way to perform the matching of the set of commands against the current device config. If match is set to line, commands are
   -                     • strict       matched line by line. If match is set to strict, command lines are matched with respect to position. If match is set to exact, command lines must be an equal
                         • exact        match. Finally, if match is set to none, the module will not attempt to compare the source configuration with the running configuration on the remote device.
                         • none
   multiline_delimiter Default:         This argument is used when pushing a multiline configuration element to the Ordnance router. It specifies the character to use as the delimiting character.
   -                   "@"              This only applies to the configuration action
   parents                              The ordered set of parents that uniquely identify the section or hierarchy the commands should be checked against. If the parents argument is omitted, the
   -                                    commands are checked against the set of top level or global commands.
   replace               Choices:       Instructs the module on the way to perform the configuration on the device. If the replace argument is set to line then the modified lines are pushed to the
   -                     • line ←       device in configuration mode. If the replace argument is set to block then the entire command block is pushed to the device in configuration mode if any line
                         • block        is not correct.
   save                  Choices:       The save argument instructs the module to save the running- config to the startup-config at the conclusion of the module running. If check mode is specified,
   boolean               • no ←         this argument is ignored.
                         • yes
   src                                  Specifies the source path to the file that contains the configuration or configuration template to load. The path to the source file can either be the full
   -                                    path on the Ansible control host or a relative path from the playbook or role root directory. This argument is mutually exclusive with lines, parents.
