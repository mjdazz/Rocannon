DEPRECATED                   *gcp_forwarding_rule*

                                        Removed in Ansible:
                  version: 2.12
        Why:      Updated modules released with increased functionality
    Alternative:  Use gcp_compute_forwarding_rule or gcp_compute_global_forwarding_rule instead.

SYNOPSIS                   *gcp_forwarding_rule-synopsis*

     • Create, Update or Destroy a Forwarding_Rule. See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/http/target-proxies for an overview. More details on the Global Forwarding_Rule API can
       be found at https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/globalForwardingRules More details on the Forwarding Rules API can be found at

REQUIREMENTS                   *gcp_forwarding_rule-requirements*

   The below requirements are needed on the host that executes this module.

     • python >= 2.6
     • google-api-python-client >= 1.6.2
     • google-auth >= 0.9.0
     • google-auth-httplib2 >= 0.0.2

PARAMETERS                   *gcp_forwarding_rule-parameters*

        Parameter       Choices/Defaults                                                                           Comments
   address                               IPv4 or named IP address. Must be of the same scope (regional, global). Reserved addresses can (and probably should) be used for global forwarding rules.
   -                                     You may reserve IPs from the console or via the gce_eip module.
   forwarding_rule_name                  Name of the Forwarding_Rule.
   - / required
   port_range                            For global forwarding rules, must be set to 80 or 8080 for TargetHttpProxy, and 443 for TargetHttpsProxy or TargetSslProxy.
   -
   protocol                              For global forwarding rules, TCP, UDP, ESP, AH, SCTP or ICMP. Default is TCP.
   -
   region                                The region for this forwarding rule. Currently, only 'global' is supported.
   -
   state                  Choices:
   - / required           • present      The state of the Forwarding Rule. 'present' or 'absent'
                          • absent
   target                                Target resource for forwarding rule. For global proxy, this is a Global TargetProxy resource. Required for external load balancing (including Global load
   -                                     balancing)

NOTES                   *gcp_forwarding_rule-notes*

   Note

     • Currently only supports global forwarding rules. As such, Load Balancing Scheme is always EXTERNAL.
