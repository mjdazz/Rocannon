SYNOPSIS                   *enos_facts*

     • Collects a base set of device facts from a remote Lenovo device running on ENOS. This module prepends all of the base network fact keys with ansible_net_<fact>. The facts module will always
       collect a base set of facts from the device and can enable or disable collection of additional facts.

PARAMETERS                   *enos_facts-parameters*

     Parameter   Choices/Defaults                                                                              Comments
   auth_pass                      Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device. If authorize is false, then this argument does nothing. If the value is
   -                              not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS will be used instead.
   authorize       Choices:       Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands. If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all commands
   boolean         • no ←         in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE will be used instead.
                   • yes
   gather_subset Default:         When supplied, this argument will restrict the facts collected to a given subset. Possible values for this argument include all, hardware, config, and interfaces.
   -             "!config"        Can specify a list of values to include a larger subset. Values can also be used with an initial ! to specify that a specific subset should not be collected.
   provider                       A dict object containing connection details.
   dictionary
     auth_pass                    Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device. If authorize is false, then this argument does nothing. If the value is
     string                       not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS will be used instead.
     authorize     Choices:       Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands. If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all commands
     boolean       • no ←         in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE will be used instead.
                   • yes
     host                         Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport. The value of host is used as the destination address for
     string /                     the transport.
     required
     password                     Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not
     string                       specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD will be used instead.
     port        Default:         Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device.
     integer     22
     ssh_keyfile                  Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is the path to the key used to authenticate the SSH session. If the
     path                         value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE will be used instead.
     timeout     Default:         Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before the
     integer     10               operation is completed, the module will error.
     username                     Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not
     string                       specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will be used instead.
