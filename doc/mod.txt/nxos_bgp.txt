NOTES                   *nxos_bgp-notes*

   Note

     • Tested against NXOSv 7.3.(0)D1(1) on VIRL
     • state=absent removes the whole BGP ASN configuration when vrf=default or the whole VRF instance within the BGP process when using a different VRF.
     • Default when supported restores params default value.
     • Configuring global params is only permitted if vrf=default.
