SYNOPSIS                   *win_regmerge*

     • Wraps the reg.exe command to import the contents of a registry file.
     • Suitable for use with registry files created using win_template.
     • Windows registry files have a specific format and must be constructed correctly with carriage return and line feed line endings otherwise they will not be merged.
     • Exported registry files often start with a Byte Order Mark which must be removed if the file is to templated using win_template.
     • Registry file format is described at https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/310516
     • See also win_template, win_regedit

PARAMETERS                   *win_regmerge-parameters*

    Parameter  Choices/Defaults                                                                               Comments
   compare_key                  The parent key to use when comparing the contents of the registry to the contents of the file. Needs to be in HKLM or HKCU part of registry. Use a PS-Drive style
   string                       path for example HKLM:\SOFTWARE not HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE If not supplied, or the registry key is not found, no comparison will be made, and the module will
                                report changed.
   path
   path /                       The full path including file name to the registry file on the remote machine to be merged
   required

NOTES                   *win_regmerge-notes*

   Note

     • Organise your registry files so that they contain a single root registry key if you want to use the compare_to functionality.
     • This module does not force registry settings to be in the state described in the file. If registry settings have been modified externally the module will merge the contents of the file but
       continue to report differences on subsequent runs.
     • To force registry change, use win_regedit with state=absent before using win_regmerge.
