SYNOPSIS                   *nxos_user*

     • This module provides declarative management of the local usernames configured on Cisco Nexus devices. It allows playbooks to manage either individual usernames or the collection of usernames
       in the current running config. It also supports purging usernames from the configuration that are not explicitly defined.

                                        A dict object containing connection details.
     auth_pass                          Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device. If authorize is false, then this argument does nothing. If the value
     string                             is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS will be used instead.
     added in 2.5.3
     authorize           Choices:       Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands. If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all
     boolean             • no ←         commands in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE will be used instead.
     added in 2.5.3      • yes
     host                               Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport. The value of host is used as the destination address
     string / required                  for the transport.
     password                           Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This is a common argument used for either cli or nxapi transports. If the
     string                             value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD will be used instead.
     port              Default:         Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device. This value applies to either cli or nxapi. The port value will default to the
     integer           "0 (use common   appropriate transport common port if none is provided in the task. (cli=22, http=80, https=443).
                       port)"
     ssh_keyfile                        Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This argument is only used for the cli transport. If the value is not
     string                             specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE will be used instead.
     timeout           Default:         Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before the
     integer           10               operation is completed, the module will error. NX-API can be slow to return on long-running commands (sh mac, sh bgp, etc).
     transport           Choices:       Configures the transport connection to use when connecting to the remote device. The transport argument supports connectivity to the device over cli (ssh) or
     string / required   • cli ←        nxapi.
                         • nxapi
     use_proxy           Choices:
     boolean             • no           If no, the environment variables http_proxy and https_proxy will be ignored.
     added in 2.5        • yes ←
     use_ssl             Choices:
     boolean             • no ←         Configures the transport to use SSL if set to yes only when the transport=nxapi, otherwise this value is ignored.
                         • yes
     username                           Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate either the CLI login or the nxapi
     string                             authentication depending on which transport is used. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will
                                        be used instead.
     validate_certs      Choices:       If no, SSL certificates will not be validated. This should only be used on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. If the transport
     boolean             • no           argument is not nxapi, this value is ignored.
                         • yes ←
   purge                 Choices:       The purge argument instructs the module to consider the resource definition absolute. It will remove any previously configured usernames on the device with
   boolean               • no ←         the exception of the `admin` user which cannot be deleted per nxos constraints.
                         • yes
   role                                 The role argument configures the role for the username in the device running configuration. The argument accepts a string value defining the role name. This
   -                                    argument does not check if the role has been configured on the device.
                                        aliases: roles
   sshkey                               The sshkey argument defines the SSH public key to configure for the username. This argument accepts a valid SSH key value.
   -
   state                 Choices:       The state argument configures the state of the username definition as it relates to the device operational configuration. When set to present, the
   -                     • present ←    username(s) should be configured in the device active configuration and when set to absent the username(s) should not be in the device active configuration
                         • absent
   update_password       Choices:       Since passwords are encrypted in the device running config, this argument will instruct the module when to change the password. When set to always, the
   -                     • on_create    password will always be updated in the device and when set to on_create the password will be updated only if the username is created.
                         • always ←
