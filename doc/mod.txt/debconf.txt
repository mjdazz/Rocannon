NOTES                   *debconf-notes*

   Note

     • This module requires the command line debconf tools.
     • A number of questions have to be answered (depending on the package). Use ‘debconf-show <package>’ on any Debian or derivative with the package installed to see questions/settings available.
     • Some distros will always record tasks involving the setting of passwords as changed. This is due to debconf-get-selections masking passwords.
