   string
   receive_disable                  This setting works like receive, except that the system marks the node or pool member disabled when its response matches the receive_disable string but not
   string                           receive. To use this setting, you must specify both receive_disable and receive.

   time_until_up                    Specifies the amount of time in seconds after the first successful response before a node will be marked up. A value of 0 will cause a node to be marked up
   integer                          immediately after a valid response is received from the node. If this parameter is not provided when creating a new monitor, then the default value will be 0.
   timeout                          The number of seconds in which the node or service must respond to the monitor request. If the target responds within the set time period, it is considered up.
   integer                          If the target does not respond within the set time period, it is considered down. You can change this number to any number you want, however, it should be 3
                                    times the interval number of seconds plus 1 second. If this parameter is not provided when creating a new monitor, then the default value will be 16.

NOTES                   *bigip_monitor_udp-notes*

   Note

     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12
     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
