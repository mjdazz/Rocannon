SYNOPSIS                   *bigip_device_group*

     • Managing device groups allows you to create HA pairs and clusters of BIG-IP devices. Usage of this module should be done in conjunction with the bigip_configsync_actions to sync
       configuration across the pair or cluster if auto-sync is disabled.

PARAMETERS                   *bigip_device_group-parameters*

           Parameter         Choices/Defaults                                                                         Comments
   auto_sync                   Choices:        Indicates whether configuration synchronization occurs manually or automatically.
   boolean                     • no            When creating a new device group, this option will default to no.
                               • yes
   description                                 Description of the device group.
   string
                                               Specifies whether the system synchronizes the entire configuration during synchronization operations.
                                               When no, the system performs incremental synchronization operations, based on the cache size specified in max_incremental_sync_size.
   full_sync                   Choices:        Incremental configuration synchronization is a mechanism for synchronizing a device-group's configuration among its members, without requiring a full
   boolean                     • no            configuration load for each configuration change.
                               • yes           In order for this to work, all devices in the device-group must initially agree on the configuration. Typically this requires at least one full
                                               configuration load to each device.
                                               When creating a new device group, this option will default to no.
                                               Specifies the size of the changes cache for incremental sync.
   max_incremental_sync_size                   For example, using the default, if you make more than 1024 KB worth of incremental changes, the system performs a full synchronization operation.
   integer                                     Using incremental synchronization operations can reduce the per-device sync/load time for configuration changes.
                                               This setting is relevant only when full_sync is no.
   name                                        Specifies the name of the device group.
   string / required
   network_failover            Choices:        Indicates whether failover occurs over the network or is hard-wired.
   boolean                     • no            This parameter is only valid for type's that are sync-failover.

NOTES                   *bigip_device_group-notes*

   Note

     • This module is primarily used as a component of configuring HA pairs of BIG-IP devices.
     • Requires BIG-IP >= 12.1.x.
     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
