   Note

     • This module must run on a windows 10 or Server 2016 host, so ensure your play targets windows hosts, or delegates to a windows host.
     • The module does not fail if there are no logged in users to notify.
     • Messages are only sent to the local host where the module is run.
     • You must run this module with async, otherwise it will hang until the expire period has passed.
