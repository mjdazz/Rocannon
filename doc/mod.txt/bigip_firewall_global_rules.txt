SYNOPSIS                   *bigip_firewall_global_rules*

     • Configures the global network firewall rules. These firewall rules are applied to all packets except those going through the management interface. They are applied first, before any firewall
       rules for the packet’s virtual server, route domain, and/or self IP.

    auth_provider                   Configures the auth provider for to obtain authentication tokens from the remote device.
    string                          This option is really used when working with BIG-IQ devices.
    password                        The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP.
    string /                        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable F5_PASSWORD.
    required                        aliases: pass, pwd
    server                          The BIG-IP host.
    string /                        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable F5_SERVER.
    required
    server_port    Default:         The BIG-IP server port.
    integer        443              You may omit this option by setting the environment variable F5_SERVER_PORT.
    ssh_keyfile                     Specifies the SSH keyfile to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This argument is only used for cli transports.

    transport        Choices:

                                    Specifies a service policy that would apply to traffic globally.
   service_policy                   The service policy is applied to all flows, provided if there are no other context specific service policy configuration that overrides the global service
   string                           policy. For example, when a service policy is configured both at a global level, as well as on a firewall rule, and a flow matches the rule, the more specific
                                    service policy configuration in the rule will override the service policy setting at the global level.
                                    The service policy associated here can be created using the bigip_service_policy module.
   staged_policy                    Specifies a staged firewall policy.
   string                           staged_policy rules are not enforced while all the visibility aspects namely statistics, reporting and logging function as if the staged-policy rules were
                                    enforced globally.

NOTES                   *bigip_firewall_global_rules-notes*

   Note

     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
