SYNOPSIS                   *nxos_nxapi*

     • Configures the NXAPI feature on devices running Cisco NXOS. The NXAPI feature is absent from the configuration by default. Since this module manages the NXAPI feature it only supports the
       use of the Cli transport.

PARAMETERS                   *nxos_nxapi-parameters*

       Parameter      Choices/Defaults                                                                            Comments
   http                 Choices:       Controls the operating state of the HTTP protocol as one of the underlying transports for NXAPI. By default, NXAPI will enable the HTTP transport when the
   boolean              • no           feature is first configured. To disable the use of the HTTP transport, set the value of this argument to False.
                        • yes ←        aliases: enable_http
   http_port          Default:         Configure the port with which the HTTP server will listen on for requests. By default, NXAPI will bind the HTTP service to the standard HTTP port 80. This
   -                  80               argument accepts valid port values in the range of 1 to 65535.
   https                Choices:       Controls the operating state of the HTTPS protocol as one of the underlying transports for NXAPI. By default, NXAPI will disable the HTTPS transport when the
   boolean              • no ←         feature is first configured. To enable the use of the HTTPS transport, set the value of this argument to True.
                        • yes          aliases: enable_https
   https_port         Default:         Configure the port with which the HTTPS server will listen on for requests. By default, NXAPI will bind the HTTPS service to the standard HTTPS port 443. This
   -                  443              argument accepts valid port values in the range of 1 to 65535.
                                       Deprecated
                                       Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using connection: network_cli.
                                       This option is only required if you are using NX-API.

                                       A dict object containing connection details.
     auth_pass                         Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device. If authorize is false, then this argument does nothing. If the value
     string                            is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS will be used instead.
     added in 2.5.3
     authorize          Choices:       Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands. If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all
     boolean            • no ←         commands in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE will be used instead.
     added in 2.5.3     • yes
     host                              Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport. The value of host is used as the destination address
     string /                          for the transport.
     required
     password                          Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This is a common argument used for either cli or nxapi transports. If the
     string                            value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD will be used instead.
     port             Default:         Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device. This value applies to either cli or nxapi. The port value will default to the
     integer          "0 (use common   appropriate transport common port if none is provided in the task. (cli=22, http=80, https=443).
                      port)"
     ssh_keyfile                       Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This argument is only used for the cli transport. If the value is not
     string                            specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE will be used instead.
     timeout          Default:         Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before the
     integer          10               operation is completed, the module will error. NX-API can be slow to return on long-running commands (sh mac, sh bgp, etc).
     transport          Choices:       Configures the transport connection to use when connecting to the remote device. The transport argument supports connectivity to the device over cli (ssh) or
     string /           • cli ←        nxapi.
     required           • nxapi
     use_proxy          Choices:
     boolean            • no           If no, the environment variables http_proxy and https_proxy will be ignored.
     added in 2.5       • yes ←
     use_ssl            Choices:
     boolean            • no ←         Configures the transport to use SSL if set to yes only when the transport=nxapi, otherwise this value is ignored.
                        • yes
     username                          Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate either the CLI login or the nxapi
     string                            authentication depending on which transport is used. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will be
                                       used instead.
     validate_certs     Choices:       If no, SSL certificates will not be validated. This should only be used on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. If the transport
     boolean            • no           argument is not nxapi, this value is ignored.
                        • yes ←
                        Choices:       The NXAPI feature provides a web base UI for developers for entering commands. This feature is initially disabled when the NXAPI feature is configured for the
   sandbox              • no ←         first time. When the sandbox argument is set to True, the developer sandbox URL will accept requests and when the value is set to False, the sandbox URL is
   boolean              • yes          unavailable. This is supported on NX-OS 7K series.
                                       aliases: enable_sandbox
   ssl_strong_ciphers   Choices:       Controls the use of whether strong or weak ciphers are configured. By default, this feature is disabled and weak ciphers are configured. To enable the use of
   boolean              • no ←         strong ciphers, set the value of this argument to True.
   added in 2.7         • yes
   state                Choices:       The state argument controls whether or not the NXAPI feature is configured on the remote device. When the value is present the NXAPI feature configuration is
   -                    • present ←    present in the device running-config. When the values is absent the feature configuration is removed from the running-config.
                        • absent
   tlsv1_0              Choices:       Controls the use of the Transport Layer Security version 1.0 is configured. By default, this feature is enabled. To disable the use of TLSV1.0, set the value
