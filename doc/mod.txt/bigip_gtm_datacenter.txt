SYNOPSIS                   *bigip_gtm_datacenter*

     • Manage BIG-IP data center configuration. A data center defines the location where the physical network components reside, such as the server and link objects that share the same subnet on
       the network. This module is able to manipulate the data center definitions in a BIG-IP.

NOTES                   *bigip_gtm_datacenter-notes*

   Note

     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
