SYNOPSIS                   *win_partition*

     • The win_partition module can create, modify or delete a partition on a disk

PARAMETERS                   *win_partition-parameters*

      Parameter        Choices/Defaults                                                                             Comments
   active             Choices:
   boolean            • no                 Specifies if the partition is active and can be used to start the system. This property is only valid when the disk's partition style is MBR.
                      • yes
   disk_number                             Disk number is mandatory for creating new partitions.
   integer                                 A combination of disk_number and partition_number can be used to specify the partition instead of drive_letter if required.
   drive_letter                            Used for accessing partitions if disk_number and partition_number are not provided.
   string                                  Use auto for automatically assigning a drive letter, or a letter A-Z for manually assigning a drive letter to a new partition. If not specified, no drive
                                           letter is assigned when creating a new partition.
                      Choices:
   gpt_type           • system_partition   Specify the partition's GPT type if the disk's partition style is GPT.
   string             • microsoft_reserved This only applies to new partitions.
                      • basic_data         This does not relate to the partitions file system formatting.
                      • microsoft_recovery
   hidden             Choices:
   boolean            • no                 Hides the target partition, making it undetectable by the mount manager.
                      • yes
                      Choices:
                      • fat12
   mbr_type           • fat16              Specify the partition's MBR type if the disk's partition style is MBR.
   string             • extended           This only applies to new partitions.
                      • huge               This does not relate to the partitions file system formatting.
                      • ifs
                      • fat32
   offline            Choices:             Sets the partition offline.
   boolean            • no                 Adding a mount point (such as a drive letter) will cause the partition to go online again.
                      • yes
   partition_number                        Used in conjunction with disk_number to uniquely identify a partition.
   integer
                                           Specify size of the partition in B, KB, KiB, MB, MiB, GB, GiB, TB or TiB. Use -1 to specify maximum supported size.
   partition_size                          Partition size is mandatory for creating a new partition but not for updating or deleting a partition.
   string                                  The decimal SI prefixes kilo, mega, giga, tera, etc., are powers of 10^3 = 1000. The binary prefixes kibi, mebi, gibi, tebi, etc. respectively refer to
                                           the corresponding power of 2^10 = 1024. Thus, a gigabyte (GB) is 1000000000 (1000^3) bytes while 1 gibibyte (GiB) is 1073741824 (1024^3) bytes.
   read_only          Choices:
   boolean            • no                 Make the partition read only, restricting changes from being made to the partition.
                      • yes
   state              Choices:             Used to specify the state of the partition. Use absent to specify if a partition should be removed and present to specify if the partition should be
   string             • absent             created or updated.
                      • present ←

     • This module cannot be used for removing the drive letter associated with a partition, initializing a disk or, file system formatting.
     • Idempotence works only if you’re specifying a drive letter or other unique attributes such as a combination of disk number and partition number.
