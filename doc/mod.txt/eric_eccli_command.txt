SYNOPSIS                   *eric_eccli_command*

     • Sends arbitrary commands to an ERICSSON eccli node and returns the results read from the device. This module includes an argument that will cause the module to wait for a specific condition
       before returning or timing out if the condition is not met.
     • This module also support running commands in configuration mode in raw command style.

PARAMETERS                   *eric_eccli_command-parameters*

   Parameter Choices/Defaults                                                                                Comments
   commands                   List of commands to send to the remote ECCLI device over the configured provider. The resulting output from the command is returned. If the wait_for argument is
   list /                     provided, the module is not returned until the condition is satisfied or the number of retries has expired. If a command sent to the device requires answering a
   required                   prompt, it is possible to pass a dict containing command, answer and prompt. Common answers are 'y' or "\r" (carriage return, must be double quotes). See examples.
   interval  Default:         Configures the interval in seconds to wait between retries of the command. If the command does not pass the specified conditions, the interval indicates how long to
   integer   1                wait before trying the command again.
   match       Choices:       The match argument is used in conjunction with the wait_for argument to specify the match policy. Valid values are all or any. If the value is set to all then all
   string      • any          conditionals in the wait_for must be satisfied. If the value is set to any then only one of the values must be satisfied.
               • all ←
   retries   Default:         Specifies the number of retries a command should by tried before it is considered failed. The command is run on the target device every retry and evaluated against the
   integer   10               wait_for conditions.
   wait_for                   List of conditions to evaluate against the output of the command. The task will wait for each condition to be true before moving forward. If the conditional is not
   list                       true within the configured number of retries, the task fails. See examples.
                              aliases: waitfor
