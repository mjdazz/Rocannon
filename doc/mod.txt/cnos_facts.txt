SYNOPSIS                   *cnos_facts*

     • Collects a base set of device facts from a remote Lenovo device running on CNOS. This module prepends all of the base network fact keys with ansible_net_<fact>. The facts module will always
       collect a base set of facts from the device and can enable or disable collection of additional facts.

PARAMETERS                   *cnos_facts-parameters*

     Parameter   Choices/Defaults                                                                              Comments
   auth_pass                      Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device. If authorize is false, then this argument does nothing. If the value is
   -                              not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS will be used instead.

   authorize       Choices:       Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands. If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all commands
   boolean         • no ←         in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE will be used instead.
   added in 2.6    • yes
   gather_subset Default:         When supplied, this argument will restrict the facts collected to a given subset. Possible values for this argument include all, hardware, config, and interfaces.
   -             "!config"        Can specify a list of values to include a larger subset. Values can also be used with an initial ! to specify that a specific subset should not be collected.
   added in 2.6
