                                      A list of VLAN IDs that should be configured as Secondary PVLANs.
                                      primary_pvlans need to be specified to create any Secondary PVLAN.
   secondary_pvlans  Default:         If primary_pvlans isn't specified, all PVLANs will be deleted if present.
   list              []               Each member of the list requires primary_pvlan_id (int), secondary_pvlan_id (int), and pvlan_type (str) to be set.
                                      The type of the secondary PVLAN can be isolated or community. The secondary promiscuous PVLAN will be created automatically.
