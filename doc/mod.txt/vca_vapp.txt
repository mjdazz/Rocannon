NOTES                   *vca_vapp-notes*

   Note

     • VMware sold their vCloud Air service in Q2 2017.
     • VMware made significant changes to the pyvcloud interface around this time. The vca_vapp module relies on now deprecated code.
     • Mileage with vca_vapp may vary as vCloud Director APIs advance.
     • A viable alternative maybe https://github.com/vmware/ansible-module-vcloud-director
