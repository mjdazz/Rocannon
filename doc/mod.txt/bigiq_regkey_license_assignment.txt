SYNOPSIS                   *bigiq_regkey_license_assignment*

     • Manages the assignment of regkey licenses on a BIG-IQ. Assignment means that the license is assigned to a BIG-IP, or, it needs to be assigned to a BIG-IP. Additionally, this module supported
       revoking the assignments from BIG-IP devices.

PARAMETERS                   *bigiq_regkey_license_assignment-parameters*

      Parameter    Choices/Defaults                                                                             Comments
                                    When managed is no, specifies the address, or hostname, where the BIG-IQ can reach the remote device to register.
   device                           When managed is yes, specifies the managed device, or device UUID, that you want to register.
   string                           If managed is yes, it is very important that you do not have more than one device with the same name. BIG-IQ internally recognizes devices by their ID, and
                                    therefore, this module's cannot guarantee that the correct device will be registered. The device returned is the device that will be used.
   device_password                  The password of the device_username.
   string                           When managed is no, this parameter is required.

   Note

     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
