                                               Some valid choices include: "BPS_50M", "BPS_100M", "BPS_200M", "BPS_300M", "BPS_400M", "BPS_500M", "BPS_1G", "BPS_2G", "BPS_5G", "BPS_10G", "BPS_20G",

                                               Up to 16 candidate prefixes that can be used to restrict the allocation of cloudRouterIpAddress and customerRouterIpAddress for this attachment.
   candidate_subnets                           All prefixes must be within link-local address space (169.254.0.0/16) and must be /29 or shorter (/28, /27, etc). Google will attempt to select an
   list                                        unused /29 from the supplied candidate prefix(es). The request will fail if all possible /29s are in use on Google's edge. If not supplied, Google
                                               will randomly select an unused /29 from all of link-local space.
   description                                 An optional description of this resource.
   string
   edge_availability_domain                    Desired availability domain for the attachment. Only available for type PARTNER, at creation time. For improved reliability, customers should
   string                                      configure a pair of attachments with one per availability domain. The selected availability domain will be provided to the Partner via the pairing key
                                               so that the provisioned circuit will lie in the specified domain. If not specified, the value will default to AVAILABILITY_DOMAIN_ANY.
   env_type                                    Specifies which Ansible environment you're running this module within.
   string                                      This should not be set unless you know what you're doing.
                                               This only alters the User Agent string for any API requests.
   interconnect                                URL of the underlying Interconnect object that this attachment's traffic will traverse through. Required if type is DEDICATED, must not be set if type
   string                                      is PARTNER.
   name                                        Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
   string / required                           Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]"[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must
                                               be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
   project                                     The Google Cloud Platform project to use.
   string

                                               URL of the cloud router to be used for dynamic routing. This router must be in the same region as this InterconnectAttachment. The
   router                                      InterconnectAttachment will automatically connect the Interconnect to the network & region within which the Cloud Router is configured.
   dictionary / required                       This field represents a link to a Router resource in GCP. It can be specified in two ways. First, you can place a dictionary with key 'selfLink' and
                                               value of your resource's selfLink Alternatively, you can add `register: name-of-resource` to a gcp_compute_router task and then set this router field
                                               to "{{ name-of-resource }}"
   scopes                                      Array of scopes to be used.
