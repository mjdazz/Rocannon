SYNOPSIS                   *bigip_imish_config*

     • This module provides an implementation for working with advanced routing configuration sections in a deterministic way.

PARAMETERS                   *bigip_imish_config-parameters*

       Parameter     Choices/Defaults                                                                            Comments
   after                              The ordered set of commands to append to the end of the command stack if a change needs to be made.
   list                               Just like with before this allows the playbook designer to append a set of commands to be executed after the command set.
   backup              Choices:       This argument will cause the module to create a full backup of the current running-config from the remote device before any changes are made.
   boolean             • no ←         The backup file is written to the backup folder in the playbook root directory or role root directory, if playbook is part of an ansible role. If the directory
                       • yes          does not exist, it is created.
   backup_options                     This is a dict object containing configurable options related to backup file path. The value of this option is read only when backup is set to yes, if backup
   dictionary                         is set to no this option will be silently ignored.
   added in 2.8
     dir_path                         This option provides the path ending with directory name in which the backup configuration file will be stored. If the directory does not exist it will be
     path                             first created and the filename is either the value of filename or default filename as described in filename options description. If the path value is not given
                                      in that case a backup directory will be created in the current working directory and backup configuration will be copied in filename within backup directory.
     filename                         The filename to be used to store the backup configuration. If the the filename is not given it will be generated based on the hostname, current time and date
     string                           in format defined by <hostname>_config.<current-date>@<current-time>
   before                             The ordered set of commands to push on to the command stack if a change needs to be made.
   list                               This allows the playbook designer the opportunity to perform configuration commands prior to pushing any changes without affecting how the set of commands are
                                      matched against the system.
                                      When using the ansible-playbook --diff command line argument the module can generate diffs against different sources.
                       Choices:       When this option is configure as startup, the module will return the diff of the running-config against the startup-config.
   diff_against        • startup ←    When this option is configured as intended, the module will return the diff of the running-config against the configuration provided in the intended_config
   string              • intended     argument.
                       • running      When this option is configured as running, the module will return the before and after diff of the running-config with respect to any changes made to the
                                      device configuration.
   diff_ignore_lines                  Use this argument to specify one or more lines that should be ignored during the diff.
   list                               This is used for lines in the configuration that are automatically updated by the system.
                                      This argument takes a list of regular expressions or exact line matches.
   intended_config                    The intended_config provides the master configuration that the node should conform to and is used to check the final running-config against.
   string                             This argument will not modify any settings on the remote device and is strictly used to check the compliance of the current device's configuration against.
                                      When specifying this argument, the task should also modify the diff_against value and set it to intended.
                                      The ordered set of commands that should be configured in the section.
   lines                              The commands must be the exact same commands as found in the device running-config.
   list                               Be sure to note the configuration command syntax as some commands are automatically modified by the device config parser.
                                      aliases: commands
                       Choices:       Instructs the module on the way to perform the matching of the set of commands against the current device config.
   match               • line ←       If match is set to line, commands are matched line by line.
   string              • strict       If match is set to strict, command lines are matched with respect to position.
                       • exact        If match is set to exact, command lines must be an equal match.
                       • none         Finally, if match is set to none, the module will not attempt to compare the source configuration with the running configuration on the remote device.
   parents                            The ordered set of parents that uniquely identify the section or hierarchy the commands should be checked against.
   list                               If the parents argument is omitted, the commands are checked against the set of top level or global commands.
   provider

   added in 2.5
     auth_provider                    Configures the auth provider for to obtain authentication tokens from the remote device.
     string                           This option is really used when working with BIG-IQ devices.
     password                         The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP.
     string /                         You may omit this option by setting the environment variable F5_PASSWORD.
     required                         aliases: pass, pwd
     server                           The BIG-IP host.
     string /                         You may omit this option by setting the environment variable F5_SERVER.
     required
     server_port     Default:         The BIG-IP server port.
     integer         443              You may omit this option by setting the environment variable F5_SERVER_PORT.
     ssh_keyfile                      Specifies the SSH keyfile to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This argument is only used for cli transports.
     path                             You may omit this option by setting the environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE.
     timeout                          Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before the
     integer                          operation is completed, the module will error.
     transport         Choices:
     string            • cli          Configures the transport connection to use when connecting to the remote device.
                       • rest ←
     user                             The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device.
     string /                         You may omit this option by setting the environment variable F5_USER.
     required
     validate_certs    Choices:       If no, SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates.
     boolean           • no           You may omit this option by setting the environment variable F5_VALIDATE_CERTS.
                       • yes ←
   replace             Choices:       Instructs the module on the way to perform the configuration on the device.
   string              • line ←       If the replace argument is set to line then the modified lines are pushed to the device in configuration mode.
                       • block        If the replace argument is set to block then the entire command block is pushed to the device in configuration mode if any line is not correct.
   route_domain      Default:         Route domain to manage BGP configuration on.
   string            0
                                      The module, by default, will connect to the remote device and retrieve the current running-config to use as a base for comparing against the contents of
   running_config                     source.
   string                             There are times when it is not desirable to have the task get the current running-config for every task in a playbook.
                                      The running_config argument allows the implementer to pass in the configuration to use as the base config for comparison.
                                      aliases: config
                       Choices:       When changes are made to the device running-configuration, the changes are not copied to non-volatile storage by default.
   save_when           • always       If the argument is set to always, then the running-config will always be copied to the startup-config and the modified flag will always be set to True.
   string              • never ←      If the argument is set to modified, then the running-config will only be copied to the startup-config if it has changed since the last save to startup-config.
                       • modified     If the argument is set to never, the running-config will never be copied to the startup-config.
                       • changed      If the argument is set to changed, then the running-config will only be copied to the startup-config if the task has made a change.
   src                                The src argument provides a path to the configuration file to load into the remote system.
   path                               The path can either be a full system path to the configuration file if the value starts with / or relative to the root of the implemented role or playbook.
                                      This argument is mutually exclusive with the lines and parents arguments.

NOTES                   *bigip_imish_config-notes*

   Note

     • Abbreviated commands are NOT idempotent, see Network FAQ.
     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
