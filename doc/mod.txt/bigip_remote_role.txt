SYNOPSIS                   *bigip_remote_role*

     • Manages remote roles on a BIG-IP. Remote roles are used in situations where user authentication is handled off-box. Local access control to the BIG-IP is controlled by the defined remote
       role. Where-as authentication (and by extension, assignment to the role) is handled off-box.

PARAMETERS                   *bigip_remote_role-parameters*

      Parameter     Choices/Defaults                                                                             Comments
                                     Specifies the authorization (level of access) for the account.
                                     When creating a new remote role, if this parameter is not provided, the default is none.
   assigned_role                     The partition_access parameter controls which partitions the account can access.
   string                            The chosen role may affect the partitions that one is allowed to specify. Specifically, roles such as administrator, auditor and resource-administrator required
                                     a partition_access of all.
                                     A set of pre-existing roles ship with the system. They are none, guest, operator, application-editor, manager, certificate-manager, irule-manager, user-manager,
                                     resource-administrator, auditor, administrator, firewall-manager.
   attribute_string                  Specifies the user account attributes saved in the group, in the format cn=, ou=, dc=.
   string                            When creating a new remote role, this parameter is required.
                                     Specifies the order of the line in the file /config/bigip/auth/remoterole.
   line_order                        The LDAP and Active Directory servers read this file line by line.
   integer                           The order of the information is important; therefore, F5 recommends that you set the first line at 1000. This allows you, in the future, to insert lines before
                                     the first line.
                                     When creating a new remote role, this parameter is required.
   name
   string /                          Specifies the name of the remote role.
   required
                                     Specifies the accessible partitions for the account.
   partition_access                  This parameter supports the reserved names all and Common, as well as specific partitions a user may access.
   string                            Users who have access to a partition can operate on objects in that partition, as determined by the permissions conferred by the user's assigned_role.
                                     When creating a new remote role, if this parameter is not specified, the default is all.
   provider
   dictionary                        A dict object containing connection details.
   added in 2.5
     auth_provider                   Configures the auth provider for to obtain authentication tokens from the remote device.
     string                          This option is really used when working with BIG-IQ devices.

     string /                        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable F5_PASSWORD.

     ssh_keyfile                     Specifies the SSH keyfile to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This argument is only used for cli transports.
     path                            You may omit this option by setting the environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE.
     timeout                         Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before the

NOTES                   *bigip_remote_role-notes*

   Note

     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
