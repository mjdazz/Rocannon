SYNOPSIS                   *cnos_rollback*

     • This module allows you to work with switch configurations. It provides a way to roll back configurations of a switch from a remote server. This is achieved by using startup or running
       configurations of the target device that were previously backed up to a remote server using FTP, SFTP, TFTP, or SCP. The first step is to create a directory from where the remote server can
       be reached. The next step is to provide the full file path of he backup configuration’s location. Authentication details required by the remote server must be provided as well. By default,
       this method overwrites the switch’s configuration file with the newly downloaded file. This module uses SSH to manage network device configuration. The results of the operation will be
       placed in a directory named ‘results’ that must be created by the user in their local directory to where the playbook is run.

                    Choices:
                    • running-config
   configType       • startup-config This refers to the type of configuration which will be used for the rolling back process. The choices are the running or startup configurations. There is no
   - / required                      default value, so it will result in an error if the input is incorrect.
                  Default:
                  null
                    Choices:
                    • g8272_cnos
                    • g8296_cnos
   deviceType       • g8332_cnos
   string /         • NE0152T        This specifies the type of device where the method is executed. The choices NE1072T,NE1032,NE1032T,NE10032,NE2572 are added since Ansible 2.4. The choice
   required         • NE1072T        NE0152T is added since 2.8
                    • NE1032
                    • NE1032T
                    • NE10032
                    • NE2572
   enablePassword                    Configures the password used to enter Global Configuration command mode on the switch. If the switch does not request this password, the parameter is
   string                            ignored.While generally the value should come from the inventory file, you can also specify it as a variable. This parameter is optional. If it is not
                                     specified, no default value will be used.
   host                              This is the variable used to search the hosts file at /etc/ansible/hosts and identify the IP address of the device on which the template is going to be applied.
   string /                          Usually the Ansible keyword {{ inventory_hostname }} is specified in the playbook as an abstraction of the group of network elements that need to be configured.
   required
   outputfile                        This specifies the file path where the output of each command execution is saved. Each command that is specified in the merged template file and each response
   string /                          from the device are saved here. Usually the location is the results folder, but you can choose another location based on your write permission.
   required
   password                          Configures the password used to authenticate the connection to the remote device. The value of the password parameter is used to authenticate the SSH session.
   string /                          While generally the value should come from the inventory file, you can also specify it as a variable. This parameter is optional. If it is not specified, no
   required                          default value will be used.
                    Choices:
                    • SFTP
                    • SCP
   protocol         • FTP            This refers to the protocol used by the network device to interact with the remote server from where to download the backup configuration. The choices are FTP,
   - / required     • TFTP           SFTP, TFTP, or SCP. Any other protocols will result in error. If this parameter is not specified, there is no default value to be used.

                  Default:
                  null
   rcpath         Default:           This specifies the full file path of the configuration file located on the remote server. In case the relative path is used as the variable value, the root
   - / required   null               folder for the user of the server needs to be specified.
   rcserverip     Default:           This specifies the IP Address of the remote server from where the backup configuration will be downloaded.
   - / required   null
   serverpassword Default:           Specify password for the server relating to the protocol used.
   - / required   null
   serverusername Default:           Specify username for the server relating to the protocol used.
   - / required   null
   username                          Configures the username used to authenticate the connection to the remote device. The value of the username parameter is used to authenticate the SSH session.
   string /                          While generally the value should come from the inventory file, you can also specify it as a variable. This parameter is optional. If it is not specified, no
