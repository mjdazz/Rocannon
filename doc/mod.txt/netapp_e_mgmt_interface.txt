NOTES                   *netapp_e_mgmt_interface-notes*

   Note

     • Check mode is supported.
     • The interface settings are applied synchronously, but changes to the interface itself (receiving a new IP address via dhcp, etc), can take seconds or minutes longer to take effect.
     • Known issue: Changes specifically to down ports will result in a failure. However, this may not be the case in up coming NetApp E-Series firmware releases (released after firmware version
       11.40.2).
     • The E-Series Ansible modules require either an instance of the Web Services Proxy (WSP), to be available to manage the storage-system, or an E-Series storage-system that supports the
       Embedded Web Services API.
     • Embedded Web Services is currently available on the E2800, E5700, EF570, and newer hardware models.
     • netapp_e_storage_system may be utilized for configuring the systems managed by a WSP instance.

RETURN VALUES                   *netapp_e_mgmt_interface-return values*

   Common return values are documented here, the following are the fields unique to this module:

     Key    Returned                                                                                    Description
                      Indicates whether IPv4 connectivity has been enabled or disabled.
   enabled on success This does not necessarily indicate connectivity. If dhcp was enabled absent a dhcp server, for instance, it is unlikely that the configuration will actually be valid.
   boolean            Sample:
                      True
   msg                Success message
   string  on success Sample:
                      The interface settings have been updated.
