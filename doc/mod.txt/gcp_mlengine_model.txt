SYNOPSIS                   *gcp_mlengine_model*

     • Represents a machine learning solution.
     • A model can have multiple versions, each of which is a deployed, trained model ready to receive prediction requests. The model itself is just a container.

NOTES                   *gcp_mlengine_model-notes*

   Note

     • for authentication, you can set service_account_file using the c(gcp_service_account_file) env variable.
     • for authentication, you can set service_account_contents using the c(GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CONTENTS) env variable.
     • For authentication, you can set service_account_email using the GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL env variable.
     • For authentication, you can set auth_kind using the GCP_AUTH_KIND env variable.
     • For authentication, you can set scopes using the GCP_SCOPES env variable.
     • Environment variables values will only be used if the playbook values are not set.
     • The service_account_email and service_account_file options are mutually exclusive.
