     • In order to use this module you have to install oVirt Python SDK. To ensure it’s installed with correct version you can create the following task: pip: name=ovirt-engine-sdk-python
       version=4.3.0

EXAMPLES                   *ovirt_permission_info-examples*

 # Examples don't contain auth parameter for simplicity,
 # look at ovirt_auth module to see how to reuse authentication:

 # Gather information about all permissions of user with username C(john):
 - ovirt_permission_info:
     user_name: john
     authz_name: example.com-authz
   register: result
 - debug:
     msg: "{{ result.ovirt_permissions }}"
