        auth_pass                         Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device. If authorize is false, then this argument does nothing. If the
        -                                 value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS will be used instead.
        authorize          Choices:       Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands. If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all
        boolean            • no ←         commands in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE will be used instead.

        host                              Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport. The value of host is used as the destination

        password                          Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not
        -                                 specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD will be used instead.

        ssh_keyfile                       Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is the path to the key used to authenticate the SSH session.
        -                                 If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE will be used instead.
