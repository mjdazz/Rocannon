SYNOPSIS                   *aruba_config*

     • Aruba configurations use a simple block indent file syntax for segmenting configuration into sections. This module provides an implementation for working with Aruba configuration sections in
       a deterministic way.

PARAMETERS                   *aruba_config-parameters*

       Parameter     Choices/Defaults                                                                            Comments
   after                              The ordered set of commands to append to the end of the command stack if a change needs to be made. Just like with before this allows the playbook designer to
   -                                  append a set of commands to be executed after the command set.
   backup              Choices:       This argument will cause the module to create a full backup of the current running-config from the remote device before any changes are made. If the
   boolean             • no ←         backup_options value is not given, the backup file is written to the backup folder in the playbook root directory. If the directory does not exist, it is
                       • yes          created.
   backup_options                     This is a dict object containing configurable options related to backup file path. The value of this option is read only when backup is set to yes, if backup
   dictionary                         is set to no this option will be silently ignored.
   added in 2.8
      dir_path                        This option provides the path ending with directory name in which the backup configuration file will be stored. If the directory does not exist it will be
      path                            first created and the filename is either the value of filename or default filename as described in filename options description. If the path value is not given
                                      in that case a backup directory will be created in the current working directory and backup configuration will be copied in filename within backup directory.
      filename                        The filename to be used to store the backup configuration. If the the filename is not given it will be generated based on the hostname, current time and date
      -                               in format defined by <hostname>_config.<current-date>@<current-time>
   before                             The ordered set of commands to push on to the command stack if a change needs to be made. This allows the playbook designer the opportunity to perform
   -                                  configuration commands prior to pushing any changes without affecting how the set of commands are matched against the system.
                                      When using the ansible-playbook --diff command line argument the module can generate diffs against different sources.
                       Choices:       When this option is configure as startup, the module will return the diff of the running-config against the startup-config.
   diff_against        • startup      When this option is configured as intended, the module will return the diff of the running-config against the configuration provided in the intended_config
   -                   • intended     argument.
                       • running      When this option is configured as running, the module will return the before and after diff of the running-config with respect to any changes made to the
                                      device configuration.
   diff_ignore_lines                  Use this argument to specify one or more lines that should be ignored during the diff. This is used for lines in the configuration that are automatically
   -                                  updated by the system. This argument takes a list of regular expressions or exact line matches.
   encrypt             Choices:       This allows an Aruba controller's passwords and keys to be displayed in plain text when set to false or encrypted when set to true. If set to false, the
   boolean             • no           setting will re-encrypt at the end of the module run. Backups are still encrypted even when set to false.
   added in 2.5        • yes ←
   intended_config                    The intended_config provides the master configuration that the node should conform to and is used to check the final running-config against. This argument will
   -                                  not modify any settings on the remote device and is strictly used to check the compliance of the current device's configuration against. When specifying this
                                      argument, the task should also modify the diff_against value and set it to intended.
   lines                              The ordered set of commands that should be configured in the section. The commands must be the exact same commands as found in the device running-config. Be
   -                                  sure to note the configuration command syntax as some commands are automatically modified by the device config parser.

   match               • line ←       Instructs the module on the way to perform the matching of the set of commands against the current device config. If match is set to line, commands are matched
   -                   • strict       line by line. If match is set to strict, command lines are matched with respect to position. If match is set to exact, command lines must be an equal match.
                       • exact        Finally, if match is set to none, the module will not attempt to compare the source configuration with the running configuration on the remote device.

   parents                            The ordered set of parents that uniquely identify the section or hierarchy the commands should be checked against. If the parents argument is omitted, the
   -                                  commands are checked against the set of top level or global commands.

   -
      host                            Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport. The value of host is used as the destination address
      string /                        for the transport.
      required
      password                        Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not
      string                          specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD will be used instead.
      port           Default:         Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote. device.
      integer        22
      ssh_keyfile                     Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is the path to the key used to authenticate the SSH session. If
      path                            the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE will be used instead.
      timeout        Default:         Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before the
      integer        10               operation is completed, the module will error.
      username                        Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not
      string                          specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will be used instead.
   replace             Choices:       Instructs the module on the way to perform the configuration on the device. If the replace argument is set to line then the modified lines are pushed to the
   -                   • line ←       device in configuration mode. If the replace argument is set to block then the entire command block is pushed to the device in configuration mode if any line
                       • block        is not correct.
                                      The module, by default, will connect to the remote device and retrieve the current running-config to use as a base for comparing against the contents of
   running_config                     source. There are times when it is not desirable to have the task get the current running-config for every task in a playbook. The running_config argument
   -                                  allows the implementer to pass in the configuration to use as the base config for comparison.
