                                          Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using connection: network_cli and become: yes with become_pass.

                                          Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device. If authorize is false, then this argument does nothing. If the
                                          value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS will be used instead.

                                          Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands. If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all
                                          commands in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE will be used instead.
   delay                 Default:         Time in seconds to wait before checking for the operational state on remote device. This wait is applicable for operational state arguments.

                                          A dict object containing connection details.
      auth_pass                           Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device. If authorize is false, then this argument does nothing. If the
      string                              value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS will be used instead.

      boolean              • no ←         commands in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE will be used instead.

      host                                Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport. The value of host is used as the destination
      string / required                   address for the transport.
      password                            Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This is a common argument used for either cli or eapi transports. If the
      string                              value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD will be used instead.
      port               Default:         Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device. This value applies to either cli or eapi.
      integer            0                The port value will default to the appropriate transport common port if none is provided in the task (cli=22, http=80, https=443).
      ssh_keyfile                         Specifies the SSH keyfile to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This argument is only used for cli transports. If the value is not
      path                                specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE will be used instead.
      timeout                             Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before the
      integer                             operation is completed, the module will error.
      transport            Choices:
      string / required    • cli ←        Configures the transport connection to use when connecting to the remote device.
                           • eapi
      use_proxy            Choices:
      boolean              • no           If no, the environment variables http_proxy and https_proxy will be ignored.

      use_ssl              Choices:
      boolean              • no           Configures the transport to use SSL if set to yes only when the transport=eapi. If the transport argument is not eapi, this value is ignored.
                           • yes ←
      username                            Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate either the CLI login or the eAPI
      string                              authentication depending on which transport is used. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will
                                          be used instead.
      validate_certs       Choices:       If no, SSL certificates will not be validated. This should only be used on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. If the transport
      boolean              • no           argument is not eapi, this value is ignored.
