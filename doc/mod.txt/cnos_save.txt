SYNOPSIS                   *cnos_save*

     • This module allows you to copy the running configuration of a switch over its startup configuration. It is recommended to use this module shortly after any major configuration changes so
       they persist after a switch restart. This module uses SSH to manage network device configuration. The results of the operation will be placed in a directory named ‘results’ that must be
       created by the user in their local directory to where the playbook is run.

   deviceType       • g8332_cnos
   string /         • NE0152T      This specifies the type of device where the method is executed. The choices NE1072T,NE1032,NE1032T,NE10032,NE2572 are added since Ansible 2.4. The choice NE0152T
   required         • NE1072T      is added since 2.8
                    • NE1032
                    • NE1032T
                    • NE10032
                    • NE2572
   enablePassword                  Configures the password used to enter Global Configuration command mode on the switch. If the switch does not request this password, the parameter is
   string                          ignored.While generally the value should come from the inventory file, you can also specify it as a variable. This parameter is optional. If it is not specified,
                                   no default value will be used.
   host                            This is the variable used to search the hosts file at /etc/ansible/hosts and identify the IP address of the device on which the template is going to be applied.
   string /                        Usually the Ansible keyword {{ inventory_hostname }} is specified in the playbook as an abstraction of the group of network elements that need to be configured.
   required
   outputfile                      This specifies the file path where the output of each command execution is saved. Each command that is specified in the merged template file and each response
   string /                        from the device are saved here. Usually the location is the results folder, but you can choose another location based on your write permission.
   required
   password                        Configures the password used to authenticate the connection to the remote device. The value of the password parameter is used to authenticate the SSH session.
   string /                        While generally the value should come from the inventory file, you can also specify it as a variable. This parameter is optional. If it is not specified, no
   required                        default value will be used.
   username                        Configures the username used to authenticate the connection to the remote device. The value of the username parameter is used to authenticate the SSH session.
   string /                        While generally the value should come from the inventory file, you can also specify it as a variable. This parameter is optional. If it is not specified, no
