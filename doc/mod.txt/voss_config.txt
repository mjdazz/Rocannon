SYNOPSIS                   *voss_config*

     • Extreme VOSS configurations use a simple flat text file syntax. This module provides an implementation for working with EXOS configuration lines in a deterministic way.

PARAMETERS                   *voss_config-parameters*

       Parameter     Choices/Defaults                                                                            Comments
   after                              The ordered set of commands to append to the end of the command stack if a change needs to be made. Just like with before this allows the playbook designer to
   -                                  append a set of commands to be executed after the command set.
   backup              Choices:       This argument will cause the module to create a full backup of the current running-config from the remote device before any changes are made. If the
   boolean             • no ←         backup_options value is not given, the backup file is written to the backup folder in the playbook root directory or role root directory, if playbook is part
                       • yes          of an ansible role. If the directory does not exist, it is created.
   backup_options                     This is a dict object containing configurable options related to backup file path. The value of this option is read only when backup is set to yes, if backup
   dictionary                         is set to no this option will be silently ignored.
   added in 2.8
         dir_path                     This option provides the path ending with directory name in which the backup configuration file will be stored. If the directory does not exist it will be
         path                         first created and the filename is either the value of filename or default filename as described in filename options description. If the path value is not given
                                      in that case a backup directory will be created in the current working directory and backup configuration will be copied in filename within backup directory.
         filename                     The filename to be used to store the backup configuration. If the the filename is not given it will be generated based on the hostname, current time and date
         -                            in format defined by <hostname>_config.<current-date>@<current-time>
   before                             The ordered set of commands to push on to the command stack if a change needs to be made. This allows the playbook designer the opportunity to perform
   -                                  configuration commands prior to pushing any changes without affecting how the set of commands are matched against the system.
   defaults            Choices:       This argument specifies whether or not to collect all defaults when getting the remote device running config. When enabled, the module will get the current
   boolean             • no ←         config by issuing the command show running-config verbose.
                       • yes
                                      When using the ansible-playbook --diff command line argument the module can generate diffs against different sources.
                       Choices:       When this option is configure as startup, the module will return the diff of the running-config against the startup-config.
   diff_against        • running      When this option is configured as intended, the module will return the diff of the running-config against the configuration provided in the intended_config
   -                   • startup      argument.
                       • intended     When this option is configured as running, the module will return the before and after diff of the running-config with respect to any changes made to the
                                      device configuration.
   diff_ignore_lines                  Use this argument to specify one or more lines that should be ignored during the diff. This is used for lines in the configuration that are automatically
   -                                  updated by the system. This argument takes a list of regular expressions or exact line matches.
   intended_config                    The intended_config provides the master configuration that the node should conform to and is used to check the final running-config against. This argument will
   -                                  not modify any settings on the remote device and is strictly used to check the compliance of the current device's configuration against. When specifying this
                                      argument, the task should also modify the diff_against value and set it to intended.
   lines                              The ordered set of commands that should be configured in the section. The commands must be the exact same commands as found in the device running-config. Be
   -                                  sure to note the configuration command syntax as some commands are automatically modified by the device config parser.
                                      aliases: commands
                       Choices:
   match               • line ←       Instructs the module on the way to perform the matching of the set of commands against the current device config. If match is set to line, commands are matched
   -                   • strict       line by line. If match is set to strict, command lines are matched with respect to position. If match is set to exact, command lines must be an equal match.
                       • exact        Finally, if match is set to none, the module will not attempt to compare the source configuration with the running configuration on the remote device.
                       • none
   parents                            The parent line that uniquely identifies the section the commands should be checked against. If this argument is omitted, the commands are checked against the
   -                                  set of top level or global commands. Note that VOSS configurations only support one level of nested commands.
   replace             Choices:       Instructs the module on the way to perform the configuration on the device. If the replace argument is set to line then the modified lines are pushed to the
   -                   • line ←       device in configuration mode. If the replace argument is set to block then the entire command block is pushed to the device in configuration mode if any line
                       • block        is not correct.
                                      The module, by default, will connect to the remote device and retrieve the current running-config to use as a base for comparing against the contents of
   running_config                     source. There are times when it is not desirable to have the task get the current running-config for every task in a playbook. The running_config argument
   -                                  allows the implementer to pass in the configuration to use as the base config for comparison.
                                      aliases: config
                       Choices:       When changes are made to the device running-configuration, the changes are not copied to non-volatile storage by default. Using this argument will change that
   save_when           • always       behavior. If the argument is set to always, then the running-config will always be saved and the modified flag will always be set to True. If the argument is
   -                   • never ←      set to modified, then the running-config will only be saved if it has changed since the last save to startup-config. If the argument is set to never, the
                       • modified     running-config will never be saved. If the argument is set to changed, then the running-config will only be saved if the task has made a change.
                       • changed
   src                                Specifies the source path to the file that contains the configuration or configuration template to load. The path to the source file can either be the full
   -                                  path on the Ansible control host or a relative path from the playbook or role root directory. This argument is mutually exclusive with lines, parents.
