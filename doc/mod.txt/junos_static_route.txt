                                         ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

                                         A dict object containing connection details.
        host                             Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport. The value of host is used as the destination
        string /                         address for the transport.
        required
        password                         Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not
        string                           specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD will be used instead.
        port            Default:         Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device. The port value will default to the well known SSH port of 22 (for
        integer         22               transport=cli) or port 830 (for transport=netconf) device.
        ssh_keyfile                      Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is the path to the key used to authenticate the SSH session. If
        path                             the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE will be used instead.
        timeout         Default:         Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before the
        integer         10               operation is completed, the module will error.
        username                         Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not
        string                           specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will be used instead.
   qualified_next_hop                    Qualified next hop IP of the static route. Qualified next hops allow to associate preference with a particular next-hop address.
   -
   qualified_preference                  Assign preference for qualified next hop.
   -
   state                  Choices:
   -                      • present ←    State of the static route configuration.
                          • absent

NOTES                   *junos_static_route-notes*

   Note

     • This module requires the netconf system service be enabled on the remote device being managed.
     • Tested against vSRX JUNOS version 15.1X49-D15.4, vqfx-10000 JUNOS Version 15.1X53-D60.4.
     • Recommended connection is netconf. See the Junos OS Platform Options.
     • This module also works with local connections for legacy playbooks.
