SYNOPSIS                   *win_package*

     • Installs or uninstalls a package in either an MSI or EXE format.
     • These packages can be sources from the local file system, network file share or a url.
     • Please read the notes section around some caveats with this module.

PARAMETERS                   *win_package-parameters*

        Parameter       Choices/Defaults                                                                           Comments
                                         Any arguments the installer needs to either install or uninstall the package.
   arguments                             If the package is an MSI do not supply the /qn, /log or /norestart arguments.
   string                                As of Ansible 2.5, this parameter can be a list of arguments and the module will escape the arguments as necessary, it is recommended to use a string when
                                         dealing with MSI packages due to the unique escaping issues with msiexec.
   chdir
   path                                  Set the specified path as the current working directory before installing or uninstalling a package.
   added in 2.8
   creates_path                          Will check the existence of the path specified and use the result to determine whether the package is already installed.
   path                                  You can use this in conjunction with product_id and other creates_".
   added in 2.4
   creates_service                       Will check the existing of the service specified and use the result to determine whether the package is already installed.
   string                                You can use this in conjunction with product_id and other creates_".
   added in 2.4
   creates_version                       Will check the file version property of the file at creates_path and use the result to determine whether the package is already installed.
   string                                creates_path MUST be set and is a file.
   added in 2.4                          You can use this in conjunction with product_id and other creates_".
   expected_return_code Default:         One or more return codes from the package installation that indicates success.
   list                 [0, 3010]        Before Ansible 2.4 this was just 0 but since Ansible 2.4 this is both 0 and 3010.
                                         A return code of 3010 usually means that a reboot is required, the reboot_required return value is set if the return code is 3010.
   log_path                              Specifies the path to a log file that is persisted after an MSI package is installed or uninstalled.
   path                                  When omitted, a temporary log file is used for MSI packages.
   added in 2.8                          This is only valid for MSI files, use arguments for other package types.
   password                              The password for user_name, must be set when user_name is.
   string                                aliases: user_password
                                         Location of the package to be installed or uninstalled.
                                         This package can either be on the local file system, network share or a url.
   path                                  If the path is on a network share and the current WinRM transport doesn't support credential delegation, then user_name and user_password must be set to
   string                                access the file.
                                         There are cases where this file will be copied locally to the server so it can access it, see the notes for more info.
                                         If state=present then this value MUST be set.
                                         If state=absent then this value does not need to be set if product_id is.
                                         The product id of the installed packaged.
                                         This is used for checking whether the product is already installed and getting the uninstall information if state=absent.
   product_id                            You can find product ids for installed programs in the Windows registry editor either at HKLM:Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall or for 32
   string                                bit programs at HKLM:Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall.
                                         This SHOULD be set when the package is not an MSI, or the path is a url or a network share and credential delegation is not being used. The creates_"
                                         options can be used instead but is not recommended.
                                         aliases: productid
   state                  Choices:       Whether to install or uninstall the package.
   string                 • absent       The module uses product_id and whether it exists at the registry path to see whether it needs to install or uninstall the package.
                          • present ←    aliases: ensure
   username                              Username of an account with access to the package if it is located on a file share.
   string                                This is only needed if the WinRM transport is over an auth method that does not support credential delegation like Basic or NTLM.
                                         aliases: user_name
   validate_certs         Choices:       If no, SSL certificates will not be validated. This should only be used on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates.
   boolean                • no           Before Ansible 2.4 this defaulted to no.
   added in 2.4           • yes ←

NOTES                   *win_package-notes*

   Note

     • When state=absent and the product is an exe, the path may be different from what was used to install the package originally. If path is not set then the path used will be what is set under
       UninstallString in the registry for that product_id.
     • Not all product ids are in a GUID form, some programs incorrectly use a different structure but this module should support any format.
     • By default all msi installs and uninstalls will be run with the options /log, /qn, /norestart.
     • It is recommended you download the package first from the URL using the win_get_url module as it opens up more flexibility with what must be set when calling win_package.
     • Packages will be temporarily downloaded or copied locally when path is a network location and credential delegation is not set, or path is a URL and the file is not an MSI.
     • All the installation checks under product_id and creates_" add together, if one fails then the program is considered to be absent.
