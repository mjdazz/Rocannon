                                     ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

                                     A dict object containing connection details.
      host                           Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport. The value of host is used as the destination address
      string /                       for the transport.
      required
      password                       Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not
      string                         specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD will be used instead.
      port          Default:         Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device. The port value will default to the well known SSH port of 22 (for transport=cli) or
      integer       22               port 830 (for transport=netconf) device.
      ssh_keyfile                    Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is the path to the key used to authenticate the SSH session. If the
      path                           value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE will be used instead.
      timeout       Default:         Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before the
      integer       10               operation is completed, the module will error.
      username                       Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not
      string                         specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will be used instead.
   rotate_frequency                  Rotate log frequency in minutes, this is applicable if value of dest is file. The acceptable value is in range of 1 to 59. This controls the frequency after
   -                                 which log file is rotated.
   size                              Size of the file in archive, this is applicable if value of dest is file. The acceptable value is in range from 65536 to 1073741824 bytes.
   -
   state              Choices:
   -                  • present ←    State of the logging configuration.
                      • absent

NOTES                   *junos_logging-notes*

   Note

     • This module requires the netconf system service be enabled on the remote device being managed.
