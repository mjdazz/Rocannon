SYNOPSIS                   *ce_facts*

     • Collects facts from CloudEngine devices running the CloudEngine operating system. Fact collection is supported over Cli transport. This module prepends all of the base network fact keys with
       ansible_net_<fact>. The facts module will always collect a base set of facts from the device and can enable or disable collection of additional facts.

PARAMETERS                   *ce_facts-parameters*

     Parameter   Choices/Defaults                                                                              Comments
   gather_subset Default:         When supplied, this argument will restrict the facts collected to a given subset. Possible values for this argument include all, hardware, config, and interfaces.
   -             "!config"        Can specify a list of values to include a larger subset. Values can also be used with an initial ! to specify that a specific subset should not be collected.

NOTES                   *ce_facts-notes*

   Note

     • Recommended connection is network_cli.
     • This module also works with local connections for legacy playbooks.
