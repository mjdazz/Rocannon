PARAMETERS                   *os_floating_ip-parameters*

        Parameter      Choices/Defaults                                                                           Comments
   api_timeout                          How long should the socket layer wait before timing out for API calls. If this is omitted, nothing will be passed to the requests library.
   integer
                                        Dictionary containing auth information as needed by the cloud's auth plugin strategy. For the default password plugin, this would contain auth_url, username,
   auth                                 password, project_name and any information about domains (for example, os_user_domain_name or os_project_domain_name) if the cloud supports them. For other
   dictionary                           plugins, this param will need to contain whatever parameters that auth plugin requires. This parameter is not needed if a named cloud is provided or
                                        OpenStack OS_" environment variables are present.
   auth_type                            Name of the auth plugin to use. If the cloud uses something other than password authentication, the name of the plugin should be indicated here and the
   string                               contents of the auth parameter should be updated accordingly.
   availability_zone                    Ignored. Present for backwards compatibility
   -
   ca_cert                              A path to a CA Cert bundle that can be used as part of verifying SSL API requests.
   string                               aliases: cacert
   client_cert                          A path to a client certificate to use as part of the SSL transaction.
   string                               aliases: cert
   client_key                           A path to a client key to use as part of the SSL transaction.
   string                               aliases: key
   cloud                                Named cloud or cloud config to operate against. If cloud is a string, it references a named cloud config as defined in an OpenStack clouds.yaml file.
   raw                                  Provides default values for auth and auth_type. This parameter is not needed if auth is provided or if OpenStack OS_" environment variables are present. If
                                        cloud is a dict, it contains a complete cloud configuration like would be in a section of clouds.yaml.
   fixed_address                        To which fixed IP of server the floating IP address should be attached to.
   -
   floating_ip_address                  A floating IP address to attach or to detach. Required only if state is absent. When state is present can be used to specify a IP address to attach.
   -
                         Choices:
   interface             • admin        Endpoint URL type to fetch from the service catalog.
   string                • internal     aliases: endpoint_type
                         • public ←

   boolean               • no ←         When state is absent, indicates whether or not to delete the floating IP completely, or only detach it from the server. Default is to detach only.

   wait                  Choices:       When attaching a floating IP address, specify whether to wait for it to appear as attached.

NOTES                   *os_floating_ip-notes*

   Note

     • The standard OpenStack environment variables, such as OS_USERNAME may be used instead of providing explicit values.
     • Auth information is driven by openstacksdk, which means that values can come from a yaml config file in /etc/ansible/openstack.yaml, /etc/openstack/clouds.yaml or
       ~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml, then from standard environment variables, then finally by explicit parameters in plays. More information can be found at
       https://docs.openstack.org/openstacksdk/

EXAMPLES                   *os_floating_ip-examples*

 # Assign a floating IP to the fist interface of `cattle001` from an exiting
 # external network or nova pool. A new floating IP from the first available
 # external network is allocated to the project.
 - os_floating_ip:
      cloud: dguerri
      server: cattle001

 # Assign a new floating IP to the instance fixed ip `192.0.2.3` of
 # `cattle001`. If a free floating IP is already allocated to the project, it is
 # reused; if not, a new one is created.
 - os_floating_ip:
      cloud: dguerri
      state: present
      reuse: yes
      server: cattle001

      wait: true

 # Assign a new floating IP from the network `ext_net` to the instance fixed
 # ip in network `private_net` of `cattle001`.
