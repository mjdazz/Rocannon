NOTES                   *jboss-notes*

   Note

     • The JBoss standalone deployment-scanner has to be enabled in standalone.xml
     • The module can wait until deployment file is deployed/undeployed by deployment-scanner. Duration of waiting time depends on scan-interval parameter from standalone.xml.
     • Ensure no identically named application is deployed through the JBoss CLI
