   api_password                       The password to authenticate with the SANtricity Web Services Proxy or Embedded Web Services API.
   string / required
   api_url                            The url to the SANtricity Web Services Proxy or Embedded Web Services API. Example https://prod-1.wahoo.acme.com/devmgr/v2
   string / required
   api_username                       The username to authenticate with the SANtricity Web Services Proxy or Embedded Web Services API.
   string / required
   components        Default:         The e-series logging components define the specific logs to transfer to the syslog server.
   -                 ["auditLog"]     At the time of writing, 'auditLog' is the only logging component but more may become available.
   log_path                           This argument specifies a local path for logging purposes.
   -
   port              Default:         This is the port the syslog server is using.

   -                   • present ←    Existing syslog server configuration will be removed or updated when its address matches address.
                       • absent       Fully qualified hostname that resolve to an IPv4 address that matches address will not be treated as a match.
   test                Choices:       This forces a test syslog message to be sent to the stated syslog server.
   boolean             • no ←         Only attempts transmission when state=present.

NOTES                   *netapp_e_syslog-notes*

   Note

     • Check mode is supported.
     • This API is currently only supported with the Embedded Web Services API v2.12 (bundled with SANtricity OS 11.40.2) and higher.
     • The E-Series Ansible modules require either an instance of the Web Services Proxy (WSP), to be available to manage the storage-system, or an E-Series storage-system that supports the
       Embedded Web Services API.
     • Embedded Web Services is currently available on the E2800, E5700, EF570, and newer hardware models.
     • netapp_e_storage_system may be utilized for configuring the systems managed by a WSP instance.
