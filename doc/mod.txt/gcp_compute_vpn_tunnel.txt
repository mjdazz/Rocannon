   dictionary                                  value of your resource's selfLink Alternatively, you can add `register: name-of-resource` to a gcp_compute_router task and then set this router field
                                               to "{{ name-of-resource }}"

   path
   shared_secret                               Shared secret used to set the secure session between the Cloud VPN gateway and the peer VPN gateway.
   string / required
   state                      Choices:
   string                     • present ←      Whether the given object should exist in GCP

                                               URL of the Target VPN gateway with which this VPN tunnel is associated.
   target_vpn_gateway                          This field represents a link to a TargetVpnGateway resource in GCP. It can be specified in two ways. First, you can place a dictionary with key
   dictionary                                  'selfLink' and value of your resource's selfLink Alternatively, you can add `register: name-of-resource` to a gcp_compute_target_vpn_gateway task and
                                               then set this target_vpn_gateway field to "{{ name-of-resource }}"
