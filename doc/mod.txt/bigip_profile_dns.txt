SYNOPSIS                   *bigip_profile_dns*

     • Manage DNS profiles on a BIG-IP. Many DNS profiles; each with their own adjustments to the standard dns profile. Users of this module should be aware that many of the adjustable knobs have
       no module default. Instead, the default is assigned by the BIG-IP system itself which, in most cases, is acceptable.

PARAMETERS                   *bigip_profile_dns-parameters*

           Parameter         Choices/Defaults                                                                        Comments
   cache_name                                 Specifies the user-created cache that the system uses to cache DNS responses.
   string                                     When you select a cache for the system to use, you must also set enable_dns_cache to yes
   added in 2.7
                                              Specifies whether the system caches DNS responses.
   enable_cache                Choices:       When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent profile.
   boolean                     • no           When yes, the BIG-IP system caches DNS responses handled by the virtual servers associated with this profile. When you enable this setting, you must
   added in 2.7                • yes          also specify a value for cache_name.
                                              When no, the BIG-IP system does not cache DNS responses handled by the virtual servers associated with this profile. However, the profile retains the
                                              association with the DNS cache in the cache_name parameter. Disable this setting when you want to debug the system.

   enable_dns_express          Choices:       When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent profile.
   boolean                     • no           The DNS Express engine receives zone transfers from the authoritative DNS server for the zone. If the enable_zone_transfer setting is also yes on this
                               • yes          profile, the DNS Express engine also responds to zone transfer requests made by the nameservers configured as zone transfer clients for the DNS Express
                                              zone.
   enable_dns_firewall         Choices:       Specifies whether DNS firewall capability is enabled.
   boolean                     • no           When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent profile.

   boolean                     • no           When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent profile.

                               • yes
                                              Specifies whether the system answers zone transfer requests for a DNS zone created on the system.
                                              When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent profile.
   enable_zone_transfer        Choices:       The enable_dns_express and enable_zone_transfer settings on a DNS profile affect how the system responds to zone transfer requests.
   boolean                     • no           When the enable_dns_express and enable_zone_transfer settings are both yes, if a zone transfer request matches a DNS Express zone, then DNS Express

                                              When the enable_dns_express setting is no and the enable_zone_transfer setting is yes, the BIG-IP system processes zone transfer requests based on the
                                              last action and answers the request from local BIND or a pool member.

   Note

     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
