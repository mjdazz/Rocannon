   name
   string /                         SSL Certificate Name. This is the cert name used when importing a certificate into the F5. It also determines the filenames of the objects on the LTM.
   required
   partition       Default:
   string          "Common"         Device partition to manage resources on.
   added in 2.5
   provider
   dictionary                       A dict object containing connection details.

    string                          This option is really used when working with BIG-IQ devices.
    password                        The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP.
    string /                        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable F5_PASSWORD.

    timeout                         Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before the
    integer                         operation is completed, the module will error.
    transport        Choices:

NOTES                   *bigip_ssl_certificate-notes*

   Note

     • This module does not behave like other modules that you might include in roles where referencing files or templates first looks in the role’s files or templates directory. To have it behave
       that way, use the Ansible file or template lookup (see Examples). The lookups behave as expected in a role context.
     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
