                                                      Specifies the basis for the hash that the system uses as the frame distribution algorithm. The system uses the resulting hash to determine
                             Choices:                 which interface to use for forwarding traffic.
   frame_distribution_hash   • destination-mac        When creating a new trunk, if this parameter is not specified, the default is source-destination-ip.
   string                    • source-destination-ip  When source-destination-mac, specifies that the system bases the hash on the combined MAC addresses of the source and the destination.
                             • source-destination-mac When destination-mac, specifies that the system bases the hash on the MAC address of the destination.
                                                      When source-destination-ip, specifies that the system bases the hash on the combined IP addresses of the source and the destination.
   interfaces                                         The interfaces that are part of the trunk.
   list                                               To clear the list of interfaces, specify an empty list.
                                                      When yes, specifies that the system supports the link aggregation control protocol (LACP), which monitors the trunk by exchanging control
   lacp_enabled              Choices:                 packets over the member links to determine the health of the links.
   boolean                   • no                     If LACP detects a failure in a member link, it removes the link from the link aggregation.
                             • yes                    When creating a new trunk, if this parameter is not specified, LACP is no.
                                                      LACP is disabled by default for backward compatibility. If this does not apply to your network, we recommend that you enable LACP.
                             Choices:                 Specifies the operation mode for link aggregation control protocol (LACP), if LACP is enabled for the trunk.
   lacp_mode                 • active                 When creating a new trunk, if this parameter is not specified, the default is active.
   string                    • passive                When active, specifies that the system periodically sends control packets regardless of whether the partner system has issued a request.
                                                      When passive, specifies that the system sends control packets only when the partner system has issued a request.
                             Choices:                 Specifies the rate at which the system sends the LACP control packets.
   lacp_timeout              • long                   When creating a new trunk, if this parameter is not specified, the default is long.
   string                    • short                  When long, specifies that the system sends an LACP control packet every 30 seconds.
                                                      When short, specifies that the system sends an LACP control packet every 1 seconds.
                                                      Specifies, once the trunk is configured, the policy that the trunk uses to determine which member link (interface) can handle new traffic.
   link_selection_policy     Choices:                 When creating a new trunk, if this value is not specific, the default is auto.
   string                    • auto                   When auto, specifies that the system automatically determines which interfaces can handle new traffic. For the auto option, the member links
                             • maximum-bandwidth      must all be the same media type and speed.
                                                      When maximum-bandwidth, specifies that the system determines which interfaces can handle new traffic based on the members' maximum bandwidth.

NOTES                   *bigip_trunk-notes*

   Note

     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
