SYNOPSIS                   *edgeos_command*

     • This command module allows running one or more commands on a remote device running EdgeOS, such as the Ubiquiti EdgeRouter.
     • This module does not support running commands in configuration mode.
     • Certain show commands in EdgeOS produce many lines of output and use a custom pager that can cause this module to hang. If the value of the environment variable
       ANSIBLE_EDGEOS_TERMINAL_LENGTH is not set, the default number of 10000 is used.
     • This is a network module and requires connection: network_cli in order to work properly.
     • For more information please see the Network Guide.

PARAMETERS                   *edgeos_command-parameters*

   Parameter Choices/Defaults                                                                                Comments
   commands                   The commands or ordered set of commands that should be run against the remote device. The output of the command is returned to the playbook. If the wait_for argument
   - /                        is provided, the module is not returned until the condition is met or the number of retries is exceeded.
   required
   interval  Default:         The number of seconds to wait between retries of the command.
   -         1
   match       Choices:       Used in conjunction with wait_for to create match policy. If set to all, then all conditions in wait_for must be met. If set to any, then only one condition must
   -           • any          match.
               • all ←
   retries   Default:         Number of times a command should be tried before it is considered failed. The command is run on the target device and evaluated against the wait_for conditionals.
   -         10
   wait_for                   Causes the task to wait for a specific condition to be met before moving forward. If the condition is not met before the specified number of retries is exceeded, the
   -                          task will fail.

NOTES                   *edgeos_command-notes*

   Note

     • Tested against EdgeOS 1.9.7
     • Running show system boot-messages all will cause the module to hang since EdgeOS is using a custom pager setting to display the output of that command.
