NOTES                   *ovirt_storage_connection-notes*

   Note

     • In order to use this module you have to install oVirt Python SDK. To ensure it’s installed with correct version you can create the following task: pip: name=ovirt-engine-sdk-python
       version=4.3.0

EXAMPLES                   *ovirt_storage_connection-examples*

 # Examples don't contain auth parameter for simplicity,
 # look at ovirt_auth module to see how to reuse authentication:

 # Add new storage connection:
 - ovirt_storage_connection:
     storage: myiscsi
     address: 10.34.63.199
     target: iqn.2016-08-09.domain-01:nickname
     port: 3260
     type: iscsi

 # Update the existing storage connection address:
 - ovirt_storage_connection:
     id: 26915c96-92ff-47e5-9e77-b581db2f2d36
     address: 10.34.63.204
     force: true

 # Remove storage connection:
 - ovirt_storage_connection:
     id: 26915c96-92ff-47e5-9e77-b581db2f2d36
