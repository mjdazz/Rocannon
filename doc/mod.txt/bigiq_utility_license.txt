SYNOPSIS                   *bigiq_utility_license*

     • Manages utility licenses on a BIG-IQ. Utility licenses are one form of licenses that BIG-IQ can distribute. These licenses, unlike regkey licenses, do not require a pool to be created before
       creation. Additionally, when assigning them, you assign by offering instead of key.

NOTES                   *bigiq_utility_license-notes*

   Note

     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
