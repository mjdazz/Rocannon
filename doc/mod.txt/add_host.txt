SYNOPSIS                   *add_host*

     • Use variables to create new hosts and groups in inventory for use in later plays of the same playbook.
     • Takes variables so you can define the new hosts more fully.
     • This module is also supported for Windows targets.

PARAMETERS                   *add_host-parameters*

       Parameter     Choices/Defaults                                                                            Comments

   name                               The hostname/ip of the host to add to the inventory, can include a colon and a port number.
   string / required                  aliases: host, hostname

NOTES                   *add_host-notes*

   Note

     • This module bypasses the play host loop and only runs once for all the hosts in the play, if you need it to iterate use a with-loop construct.
     • The alias host of the parameter name is only available on Ansible 2.4 and newer.
     • Since Ansible 2.4, the inventory_dir variable is now set to None instead of the ‘global inventory source’, because you can now have multiple sources. An example was added that shows how to
       partially restore the previous behaviour.
     • Windows targets are supported by this module.

EXAMPLES                   *add_host-examples*

 - name: Add host to group 'just_created' with variable foo=42

     name: '{{ ip_from_ec2 }}'
     groups: just_created
     foo: 42

 - name: Add host to multiple groups
   add_host:
     hostname: '{{ new_ip }}'
     groups:
     - group1
     - group2

 - name: Add a host with a non-standard port local to your machines
   add_host:
     name: '{{ new_ip }}:{{ new_port }}'

 - name: Add a host alias that we reach through a tunnel (Ansible 1.9 and older)
   add_host:
     hostname: '{{ new_ip }}'
     ansible_ssh_host: '{{ inventory_hostname }}'
     ansible_ssh_port: '{{ new_port }}'

 - name: Add a host alias that we reach through a tunnel (Ansible 2.0 and newer)
   add_host:
     hostname: '{{ new_ip }}'
     ansible_host: '{{ inventory_hostname }}'
     ansible_port: '{{ new_port }}'

 - name: Ensure inventory vars are set to the same value as the inventory_hostname has (close to pre Ansible 2.4 behaviour)
   add_host:
     hostname: charlie
     inventory_dir: '{{ inventory_dir }}'
