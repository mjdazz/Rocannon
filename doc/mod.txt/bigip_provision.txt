SYNOPSIS                   *bigip_provision*

     • Manage BIG-IP module provisioning. This module will only provision at the standard levels of Dedicated, Nominal, and Minimum.

PARAMETERS                   *bigip_provision-parameters*

      Parameter    Choices/Defaults                                                                             Comments
                     Choices:       Sets the provisioning level for the requested modules. Changing the level for one module may require modifying the level of another module. For example, changing
   level             • dedicated    one module to dedicated requires setting all others to none. Setting the level of a module to none means that the module is not activated.
   string            • nominal ←    Use state absent to set c(level) to none and de-provision module.
                     • minimum      This parameter is not relevant to cgnat - pre tmos 15.0 or mgmt and will not be applied to the cgnat - pre tmos 15.0 or mgmt module.
                                    Sets additional memory for management module. This is in addition to minimum allocated RAM of 1264MB.
                                    The accepted value range is 0 - 8192. Maximum value is restricted by systems available RAM.
   memory                           Specifying large reserves an additional 500MB for mgmt module.
   string                           Specifying medium reserves an additional 200MB for mgmt module.
   added in 2.9                     Specifying small reserves no additional RAM for mgmt module.
                                    Use large for configurations containing more than 2000 objects, or more specifically, for any configuration that exceeds 1000 objects per 2 GB of installed
                                    memory. Changing the Management mgmt size after initial provisioning causes a reprovision operation

    ssh_keyfile                     Specifies the SSH keyfile to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This argument is only used for cli transports.

                                    absent, is not a relevant option to mgmt module as module can not be de-provisioned.

NOTES                   *bigip_provision-notes*

   Note

     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
