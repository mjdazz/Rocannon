NOTES                   *ovirt_network-notes*

   Note

     • In order to use this module you have to install oVirt Python SDK. To ensure it’s installed with correct version you can create the following task: pip: name=ovirt-engine-sdk-python
       version=4.3.0

EXAMPLES                   *ovirt_network-examples*

 # Examples don't contain auth parameter for simplicity,
 # look at ovirt_auth module to see how to reuse authentication:

 # Create network
 - ovirt_network:
     data_center: mydatacenter
     name: mynetwork
     vlan_tag: 10
     vm_network: true

 # Remove network
 - ovirt_network:
     state: absent
     name: mynetwork

 # Change Network Name
 - ovirt_network:
     id: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
     name: "new_network_name"
     data_center: mydatacenter

 # Add network from external provider
 - ovirt_network:
     data_center: mydatacenter
     name: mynetwork
     external_provider: ovirt-provider-ovn

 # Remove vlan_tag
 - ovirt_network:
     data_center: mydatacenter
     name: mynetwork
     vlan_tag: -1

RETURN VALUES                   *ovirt_network-return values*

              is
              found.
