                          Choices:          Specifies the method of secure renegotiations for SSL connections. When creating a new profile, the setting is provided by the parent profile.

                          Choices:          Indicates that the system uses this profile as the default SSL profile when there is no match to the server name, or when the client provides no SNI
   sni_default            • no              extension support.
   boolean                • yes             When creating a new profile, the setting is provided by the parent profile.

   sni_require            Choices:          Requires that the network peers also provide SNI support, setting only takes effect when sni_default is yes.

   Note

     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
