PARAMETERS                   *os_ironic-parameters*

             Parameter            Choices/Defaults                                                                      Comments
   api_timeout                                     How long should the socket layer wait before timing out for API calls. If this is omitted, nothing will be passed to the requests library.
   integer
                                                   Dictionary containing auth information as needed by the cloud's auth plugin strategy. For the default password plugin, this would contain
   auth                                            auth_url, username, password, project_name and any information about domains (for example, os_user_domain_name or os_project_domain_name) if the
   dictionary                                      cloud supports them. For other plugins, this param will need to contain whatever parameters that auth plugin requires. This parameter is not
                                                   needed if a named cloud is provided or OpenStack OS_" environment variables are present.
   auth_type                                       Name of the auth plugin to use. If the cloud uses something other than password authentication, the name of the plugin should be indicated here
   string                                          and the contents of the auth parameter should be updated accordingly.

NOTES                   *os_ironic-notes*

   Note

     • The standard OpenStack environment variables, such as OS_USERNAME may be used instead of providing explicit values.
     • Auth information is driven by openstacksdk, which means that values can come from a yaml config file in /etc/ansible/openstack.yaml, /etc/openstack/clouds.yaml or
       ~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml, then from standard environment variables, then finally by explicit parameters in plays. More information can be found at
       https://docs.openstack.org/openstacksdk/
