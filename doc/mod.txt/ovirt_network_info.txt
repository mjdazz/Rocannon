SYNOPSIS                   *ovirt_network_info*

     • Retrieve information about one or more oVirt/RHV networks.
     • This module was called ovirt_network_facts before Ansible 2.9, returning ansible_facts. Note that the ovirt_network_info module no longer returns ansible_facts!

   Aliases: ovirt_network_facts

PARAMETERS                   *ovirt_network_info-parameters*

       Parameter     Choices/Defaults                                                                            Comments
                                      Dictionary with values needed to create HTTP/HTTPS connection to oVirt:
                                      username[required] - The name of the user, something like [email protected]. Default value is set by OVIRT_USERNAME environment variable.
                                      password[required] - The password of the user. Default value is set by OVIRT_PASSWORD environment variable.
                                      url- A string containing the API URL of the server, usually something like `https://server.example.com/ovirt-engine/api`. Default value is set by OVIRT_URL
                                      environment variable. Either url or hostname is required.
   auth                               hostname - A string containing the hostname of the server, usually something like `server.example.com`. Default value is set by OVIRT_HOSTNAME environment
   dictionary /                       variable. Either url or hostname is required.
   required                           token - Token to be used instead of login with username/password. Default value is set by OVIRT_TOKEN environment variable.
                                      insecure - A boolean flag that indicates if the server TLS certificate and host name should be checked.
                                      ca_file - A PEM file containing the trusted CA certificates. The certificate presented by the server will be verified using these CA certificates. If `ca_file`
                                      parameter is not set, system wide CA certificate store is used. Default value is set by OVIRT_CAFILE environment variable.
                                      kerberos - A boolean flag indicating if Kerberos authentication should be used instead of the default basic authentication.
                                      headers - Dictionary of HTTP headers to be added to each API call.
   fetch_nested        Choices:       If yes the module will fetch additional data from the API.
   boolean             • no           It will fetch only IDs of nested entity. It doesn't fetch multiple levels of nested attributes. Only the attributes of the current entity. User can configure
                       • yes          to fetch other attributes of the nested entities by specifying nested_attributes.
   nested_attributes                  Specifies list of the attributes which should be fetched from the API.
   list                               This parameter apply only when fetch_nested is true.
   pattern                            Search term which is accepted by oVirt/RHV search backend.
   -                                  For example to search network starting with string vlan1 use: name=vlan1"

NOTES                   *ovirt_network_info-notes*

   Note

     • This module returns a variable ovirt_networks, which contains a list of networks. You need to register the result with the register keyword to use it.
     • In order to use this module you have to install oVirt Python SDK. To ensure it’s installed with correct version you can create the following task: pip: name=ovirt-engine-sdk-python
       version=4.3.0

EXAMPLES                   *ovirt_network_info-examples*

 # Examples don't contain auth parameter for simplicity,
 # look at ovirt_auth module to see how to reuse authentication:

 # Gather information about all networks which names start with C(vlan1):
 - ovirt_network_info:
     pattern: name=vlan1"
   register: result
 - debug:
     msg: "{{ result.ovirt_networks }}"

RETURN VALUES                   *ovirt_network_info-return values*

   Common return values are documented here, the following are the fields unique to this module:

        Key       Returned                                                                                Description
   ovirt_networks On       List of dictionaries describing the networks. Network attributes are mapped to dictionary keys, all networks attributes can be found at following url:
