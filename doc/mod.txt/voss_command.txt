SYNOPSIS                   *voss_command*

     • Sends arbitrary commands to an Extreme VSP device running VOSS, and returns the results read from the device. This module includes an argument that will cause the module to wait for a
       specific condition before returning or timing out if the condition is not met.
     • This module does not support running commands in configuration mode. Please use voss_config to configure VOSS devices.

PARAMETERS                   *voss_command-parameters*

   Parameter Choices/Defaults                                                                                Comments
   commands                   List of commands to send to the remote VOSS device. The resulting output from the command is returned. If the wait_for argument is provided, the module is not returned
   - /                        until the condition is satisfied or the number of retries has expired. If a command sent to the device requires answering a prompt, it is possible to pass a dict
   required                   containing command, answer and prompt. Common answers are 'y' or "\r" (carriage return, must be double quotes). See examples.
   interval  Default:         Configures the interval in seconds to wait between retries of the command. If the command does not pass the specified conditions, the interval indicates how long to
   -         1                wait before trying the command again.
   match       Choices:       The match argument is used in conjunction with the wait_for argument to specify the match policy. Valid values are all or any. If the value is set to all then all
   -           • any          conditionals in the wait_for must be satisfied. If the value is set to any then only one of the values must be satisfied.
               • all ←
   retries   Default:         Specifies the number of retries a command should by tried before it is considered failed. The command is run on the target device every retry and evaluated against the
   -         10               wait_for conditions.
   wait_for                   List of conditions to evaluate against the output of the command. The task will wait for each condition to be true before moving forward. If the conditional is not
   -                          true within the configured number of retries, the task fails. See examples.
