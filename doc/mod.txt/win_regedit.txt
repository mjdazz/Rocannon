PARAMETERS                   *win_regedit-parameters*

       Parameter      Choices/Defaults                                                                            Comments
                                        Value of the registry entry name in path.
                                        If not specified then the value for the property will be null for the corresponding type.
                                        Binary and None data should be expressed in a yaml byte array or as comma separated hex values.
   data                                 An easy way to generate this is to run regedit.exe and use the export option to save the registry values to a file.
   string                               In the exported file, binary value will look like hex:be,ef,be,ef, the hex: prefix is optional.
                                        DWORD and QWORD values should either be represented as a decimal number or a hex value.
                                        Multistring values should be passed in as a list.
                                        See the examples for more details on how to format this data.
   delete_key          Choices:         When state is 'absent' then this will delete the entire key.
   boolean             • no             If no then it will only clear out the '(Default)' property for that key.
   added in 2.4        • yes ←
   hive                                 A path to a hive key like C:\Users\Default\NTUSER.DAT to load in the registry.
   path                                 This hive is loaded under the HKLM:\ANSIBLE key which can then be used in name like any other path.
   added in 2.5                         This can be used to load the default user profile registry hive or any other hive saved as a file.
                                        Using this function requires the user to have the SeRestorePrivilege and SeBackupPrivilege privileges enabled.
   name                                 Name of the registry entry in the above path parameters.
   string                               If not provided, or empty then the '(Default)' property for the key will be used.
                                        aliases: entry
   path                                 Name of the registry path.
   string / required                    Should be in one of the following registry hives: HKCC, HKCR, HKCU, HKLM, HKU.
                                        aliases: key
   state               Choices:
   string              • absent         The state of the registry entry.
                       • present ←
                       Choices:
                       • binary
   type                • dword          The registry value data type.
   string              • expandstring   aliases: datatype
                       • multistring
                       • string ←
                       • qword

NOTES                   *win_regedit-notes*

   Note

     • Check-mode -C/--check and diff output -D/--diff are supported, so that you can test every change against the active configuration before applying changes.
     • Beware that some registry hives (HKEY_USERS in particular) do not allow to create new registry paths in the root folder.
     • Since ansible 2.4, when checking if a string registry value has changed, a case-sensitive test is used. Previously the test was case-insensitive.
