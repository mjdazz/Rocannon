SYNOPSIS                   *timezone*

     • This module configures the timezone setting, both of the system clock and of the hardware clock. If you want to set up the NTP, use service module.
     • It is recommended to restart crond after changing the timezone, otherwise the jobs may run at the wrong time.
     • Several different tools are used depending on the OS/Distribution involved. For Linux it can use timedatectl or edit /etc/sysconfig/clock or /etc/timezone and hwclock. On SmartOS,
       sm-set-timezone, for macOS, systemsetup, for BSD, /etc/localtime is modified. On AIX, chtz is used.
     • As of Ansible 2.3 support was added for SmartOS and BSDs.
     • As of Ansible 2.4 support was added for macOS.
     • As of Ansible 2.9 support was added for AIX 6.1+
     • Windows and HPUX are not supported, please let us know if you find any other OS/distro in which this fails.

NOTES                   *timezone-notes*

   Note

     • On SmartOS the sm-set-timezone utility (part of the smtools package) is required to set the zone timezone
     • On AIX only Olson/tz database timezones are useable (POSIX is not supported). - An OS reboot is also required on AIX for the new timezone setting to take effect.
