SYNOPSIS                   *eos_user*

     • This module provides declarative management of the local usernames configured on Arista EOS devices. It allows playbooks to manage either individual usernames or the collection of usernames
       in the current running config. It also supports purging usernames from the configuration that are not explicitly defined.

   aggregate                            The set of username objects to be configured on the remote Arista EOS device. The list entries can either be the username or a hash of username and
   -                                    properties. This argument is mutually exclusive with the username argument.

                                        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using connection: network_cli and become: yes with become_pass.
                                        This option is only required if you are using eAPI.

                                        Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device. If authorize is false, then this argument does nothing. If the value

                                        Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands. If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all
                                        commands in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE will be used instead.
   configured_password                  The password to be configured on the remote Arista EOS device. The password needs to be provided in clear and it will be encrypted on the device. Please note
   -                                    that this option is not same as provider password.

   nopassword            Choices:
   boolean               • no           Defines the username without assigning a password. This will allow the user to login to the system without being authenticated by a password.

     auth_pass                          Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device. If authorize is false, then this argument does nothing. If the value
     string                             is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS will be used instead.

     boolean             • no ←         commands in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE will be used instead.

     host                               Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport. The value of host is used as the destination address
     string / required                  for the transport.
     password                           Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This is a common argument used for either cli or eapi transports. If the
     string                             value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD will be used instead.
     port              Default:         Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device. This value applies to either cli or eapi.
     integer           0                The port value will default to the appropriate transport common port if none is provided in the task (cli=22, http=80, https=443).
     ssh_keyfile                        Specifies the SSH keyfile to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This argument is only used for cli transports. If the value is not
     path                               specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE will be used instead.
     timeout                            Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before the
     integer                            operation is completed, the module will error.
     transport           Choices:
     string / required   • cli ←        Configures the transport connection to use when connecting to the remote device.

     boolean             • no           If no, the environment variables http_proxy and https_proxy will be ignored.

     boolean             • no           Configures the transport to use SSL if set to yes only when the transport=eapi. If the transport argument is not eapi, this value is ignored.
                         • yes ←
     username                           Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate either the CLI login or the eAPI
     string                             authentication depending on which transport is used. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will
                                        be used instead.
     validate_certs      Choices:       If no, SSL certificates will not be validated. This should only be used on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. If the transport
     boolean             • no           argument is not eapi, this value is ignored.

   purge                 Choices:       Instructs the module to consider the resource definition absolute. It will remove any previously configured usernames on the device with the exception of the

                         • yes
   role                                 Configures the role for the username in the device running configuration. The argument accepts a string value defining the role name. This argument does not
   -                                    check if the role has been configured on the device.
   sshkey                               Specifies the SSH public key to configure for the given username. This argument accepts a valid SSH key value.
   -
   state                 Choices:       Configures the state of the username definition as it relates to the device operational configuration. When set to present, the username(s) should be
   -                     • present ←    configured in the device active configuration and when set to absent the username(s) should not be in the device active configuration
                         • absent
   update_password       Choices:       Since passwords are encrypted in the device running config, this argument will instruct the module when to change the password. When set to always, the
   -                     • on_create    password will always be updated in the device and when set to on_create the password will be updated only if the username is created.
