SYNOPSIS                   *ce_config*

     • Huawei CloudEngine configurations use a simple block indent file syntax for segmenting configuration into sections. This module provides an implementation for working with CloudEngine
       configuration sections in a deterministic way. This module works with CLI transports.

PARAMETERS                   *ce_config-parameters*

     Parameter    Choices/Defaults                                                                              Comments
   after                           The ordered set of commands to append to the end of the command stack if a change needs to be made. Just like with before this allows the playbook designer to
   -                               append a set of commands to be executed after the command set.
   backup           Choices:       This argument will cause the module to create a full backup of the current current-configuration from the remote device before any changes are made. If the
   boolean          • no ←         backup_options value is not given, the backup file is written to the backup folder in the playbook root directory. If the directory does not exist, it is created.
                    • yes
   backup_options                  This is a dict object containing configurable options related to backup file path. The value of this option is read only when backup is set to yes, if backup is
   dictionary                      set to no this option will be silently ignored.
   added in 2.8
       dir_path                    This option provides the path ending with directory name in which the backup configuration file will be stored. If the directory does not exist it will be first
       path                        created and the filename is either the value of filename or default filename as described in filename options description. If the path value is not given in that
                                   case a backup directory will be created in the current working directory and backup configuration will be copied in filename within backup directory.
       filename                    The filename to be used to store the backup configuration. If the the filename is not given it will be generated based on the hostname, current time and date in
       -                           format defined by <hostname>_config.<current-date>@<current-time>
   before                          The ordered set of commands to push on to the command stack if a change needs to be made. This allows the playbook designer the opportunity to perform
   -                               configuration commands prior to pushing any changes without affecting how the set of commands are matched against the system.
   config                          The module, by default, will connect to the remote device and retrieve the current current-configuration to use as a base for comparing against the contents of
   -                               source. There are times when it is not desirable to have the task get the current-configuration for every task in a playbook. The config argument allows the
                                   implementer to pass in the configuration to use as the base config for comparison.
   defaults         Choices:       The defaults argument will influence how the current-configuration is collected from the device. When the value is set to true, the command used to collect the
   boolean          • no ←         current-configuration is append with the all keyword. When the value is set to false, the command is issued without the all keyword.
                    • yes
   lines                           The ordered set of commands that should be configured in the section. The commands must be the exact same commands as found in the device current-configuration.
   -                               Be sure to note the configuration command syntax as some commands are automatically modified by the device config parser.
                    Choices:
   match            • line ←       Instructs the module on the way to perform the matching of the set of commands against the current device config. If match is set to line, commands are matched
   -                • strict       line by line. If match is set to strict, command lines are matched with respect to position. If match is set to exact, command lines must be an equal match.
                    • exact        Finally, if match is set to none, the module will not attempt to compare the source configuration with the current-configuration on the remote device.
                    • none
   parents                         The ordered set of parents that uniquely identify the section or hierarchy the commands should be checked against. If the parents argument is omitted, the
   -                               commands are checked against the set of top level or global commands.
   replace          Choices:       Instructs the module on the way to perform the configuration on the device. If the replace argument is set to line then the modified lines are pushed to the
   -                • line ←       device in configuration mode. If the replace argument is set to block then the entire command block is pushed to the device in configuration mode if any line is
                    • block        not correct.
   save             Choices:       The save argument instructs the module to save the current-configuration to saved-configuration. This operation is performed after any changes are made to the
   boolean          • no ←         current running config. If no changes are made, the configuration is still saved to the startup config. This option will always cause the module to return
                    • yes          changed.
   src                             The src argument provides a path to the configuration file to load into the remote system. The path can either be a full system path to the configuration file if
   -                               the value starts with / or relative to the root of the implemented role or playbook. This argument is mutually exclusive with the lines and parents arguments.
