                             Choices:            Insert the virtual server's VIP address and port number in the request header. Available values function as follows:
   insertvserveripport       • OFF               VIPADDR - Header contains the vserver's IP address and port number without any translation.
   -                         • VIPADDR           OFF - The virtual IP and port header insertion option is disabled.
                             • V6TOV4MAPPING     V6TOV4MAPPING - Header contains the mapped IPv4 address corresponding to the IPv6 address of the vserver and the port number. An IPv6 address can be
                                                 mapped to a user-specified IPv4 address using the set ns ip6 command.
   ipmask                                        IP mask, in dotted decimal notation, for the IP Pattern parameter. Can have leading or trailing non-zero octets (for example, 255.255.240.0 or
   -                                             0.0.255.255). Accordingly, the mask specifies whether the first n bits or the last n bits of the destination IP address in a client request are to
                                                 be matched with the corresponding bits in the IP pattern. The former is called a forward mask. The latter is called a reverse mask.
                                                 IP address pattern, in dotted decimal notation, for identifying packets to be accepted by the virtual server. The IP Mask parameter specifies which
                                                 part of the destination IP address is matched against the pattern. Mutually exclusive with the IP Address parameter.
                                                 For example, if the IP pattern assigned to the virtual server is 198.51.100.0 and the IP mask is 255.255.240.0 (a forward mask), the first 20 bits
                                                 in the destination IP addresses are matched with the first 20 bits in the pattern. The virtual server accepts requests with IP addresses that range
   ippattern                                     from 198.51.96.1 to 198.51.111.254. You can also use a pattern such as 0.0.2.2 and a mask such as 0.0.255.255 (a reverse mask).
   -                                             If a destination IP address matches more than one IP pattern, the pattern with the longest match is selected, and the associated virtual server
                                                 processes the request. For example, if the virtual servers, vs1 and vs2, have the same IP pattern, 0.0.100.128, but different IP masks of
                                                 0.0.255.255 and 0.0.224.255, a destination IP address of 198.51.100.128 has the longest match with the IP pattern of vs1. If a destination IP
                                                 address matches two or more virtual servers to the same extent, the request is processed by the virtual server whose port number matches the port
                                                 number in the request.
   ipv46                                         IP address of the content switching virtual server.
