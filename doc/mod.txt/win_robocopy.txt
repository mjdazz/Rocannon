SYNOPSIS                   *win_robocopy*

     • Synchronizes the contents of files/directories from a source to destination.
     • Under the hood this just calls out to RoboCopy, since that should be available on most modern Windows systems.

PARAMETERS                   *win_robocopy-parameters*

      Parameter    Choices/Defaults                                                                             Comments
   dest                             Destination file/directory to sync (Will receive contents of src).
   path / required
   flags                            Directly supply Robocopy flags.
   string                           If set, purge and recurse will be ignored.
   purge             Choices:       Deletes any files/directories found in the destination that do not exist in the source.
   boolean           • no ←         Toggles the /purge flag to RoboCopy.
                     • yes          If flags is set, this will be ignored.
   recurse           Choices:       Includes all subdirectories (Toggles the /e flag to RoboCopy).
   boolean           • no ←         If flags is set, this will be ignored.
                     • yes
   src                              Source file/directory to sync.
   path / required

NOTES                   *win_robocopy-notes*

   Note

     • This is not a complete port of the synchronize module. Unlike the synchronize module this only performs the sync/copy on the remote machine, not from the master to the remote machine.
     • This module does not currently support all Robocopy flags.
