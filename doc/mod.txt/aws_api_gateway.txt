SYNOPSIS                   *aws_api_gateway*

     • Allows for the management of API Gateway APIs
     • Normally you should give the api_id since there is no other stable guaranteed unique identifier for the API. If you do not give api_id then a new API will be create each time this is run.
     • Beware that there are very hard limits on the rate that you can call API Gateway’s REST API. You may need to patch your boto. See https://github.com/boto/boto3/issues/876 and discuss with
       your AWS rep.
     • swagger_file and swagger_text are passed directly on to AWS transparently whilst swagger_dict is an ansible dict which is converted to JSON before the API definitions are uploaded.

NOTES                   *aws_api_gateway-notes*

   Note

     • A future version of this module will probably use tags or another ID so that an API can be create only once.
     • As an early work around an intermediate version will probably do the same using a tag embedded in the API name.
     • If parameters are not set within the module, the following environment variables can be used in decreasing order of precedence AWS_URL or EC2_URL, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID or AWS_ACCESS_KEY or
       EC2_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY or AWS_SECRET_KEY or EC2_SECRET_KEY, AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN or EC2_SECURITY_TOKEN, AWS_REGION or EC2_REGION
     • Ansible uses the boto configuration file (typically ~/.boto) if no credentials are provided. See https://boto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/boto_config_tut.html
     • AWS_REGION or EC2_REGION can be typically be used to specify the AWS region, when required, but this can also be configured in the boto config file
