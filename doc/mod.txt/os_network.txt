   admin_state_up              Choices:
   boolean                     • no           Whether the state should be marked as up or down.

                                              Dictionary containing auth information as needed by the cloud's auth plugin strategy. For the default password plugin, this would contain auth_url,
   auth                                       username, password, project_name and any information about domains (for example, os_user_domain_name or os_project_domain_name) if the cloud supports
   dictionary                                 them. For other plugins, this param will need to contain whatever parameters that auth plugin requires. This parameter is not needed if a named cloud
                                              is provided or OpenStack OS_" environment variables are present.

   raw                                        Provides default values for auth and auth_type. This parameter is not needed if auth is provided or if OpenStack OS_" environment variables are
                                              present. If cloud is a dict, it contains a complete cloud configuration like would be in a section of clouds.yaml.

NOTES                   *os_network-notes*

   Note

     • The standard OpenStack environment variables, such as OS_USERNAME may be used instead of providing explicit values.
     • Auth information is driven by openstacksdk, which means that values can come from a yaml config file in /etc/ansible/openstack.yaml, /etc/openstack/clouds.yaml or
       ~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml, then from standard environment variables, then finally by explicit parameters in plays. More information can be found at
       https://docs.openstack.org/openstacksdk/
