SYNOPSIS                   *bigip_monitor_snmp_dca*

     • The BIG-IP has an SNMP data collecting agent (DCA) that can query remote SNMP agents of various types, including the UC Davis agent (UCD) and the Windows 2000 Server agent (WIN2000).

   time_until_up                         Specifies the number of seconds to wait after a resource first responds correctly to the monitor before setting the resource to 'up'. During the interval,
   integer                               all responses from the resource must be correct. When the interval expires, the resource is marked 'up'. A value of 0, means that the resource is marked up
                                         immediately upon receipt of the first correct response. When creating a new monitor, the default is 0.
                                         Specifies the number of seconds the target has in which to respond to the monitor request. When creating a new monitor, the default is 30 seconds. If the
   timeout                               target responds within the set time period, it is considered 'up'. If the target does not respond within the set time period, it is considered 'down'. When
   integer                               this value is set to 0 (zero), the system uses the interval from the parent monitor. Note that timeout and time_until_up combine to control when a resource
                                         is set to up.
   version              Choices:         Specifies the version of SNMP that the host server uses. When creating a new monitor, the default is v1. When v1, specifies that the host server uses SNMP
   string               • v1             version 1. When v2c, specifies that the host server uses SNMP version 2c.
                        • v2c

NOTES                   *bigip_monitor_snmp_dca-notes*

   Note

     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12
     • This module does not support the variables option because this option is broken in the REST API and does not function correctly in tmsh; for example you cannot remove user-defined params.
       Therefore, there is no way to automatically configure it.
     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
