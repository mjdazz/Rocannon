SYNOPSIS                   *docker_config*

     • Create and remove Docker configs in a Swarm environment. Similar to docker config create and docker config rm.
     • Adds to the metadata of new configs ‘ansible_key’, an encrypted hash representation of the data, which is then used in future runs to test if a config has changed. If ‘ansible_key’ is not
       present, then a config will not be updated unless the force option is set.
     • Updates to configs are performed by removing the config and creating it again.

REQUIREMENTS                   *docker_config-requirements*

   The below requirements are needed on the host that executes this module.

     • Docker API >= 1.30
     • Docker SDK for Python: Please note that the docker-py Python module has been superseded by docker (see here for details). This module does not work with docker-py.
     • Docker SDK for Python >= 2.6.0
     • Python >= 2.7

   string
   data_is_b64      Choices:                   If set to true, the data is assumed to be Base64 encoded and will be decoded before being used.
   boolean          • no ←                     To use binary data, it is better to keep it Base64 encoded and let it be decoded by this option.
                    • yes
   debug            Choices:
   boolean          • no ←                     Debug mode

   docker_host    Default:                     tcp://192.0.2.23:2376. If TLS is used to encrypt the connection, the module will automatically replace tcp in the connection URL with https.
   string         "unix://var/run/docker.sock" If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable DOCKER_HOST will be used instead. If the environment variable is not set,

   boolean          • no ←                     If true, an existing config will be replaced, even if it has not been changed.
                    • yes
   labels                                      A map of key:value meta data, where both the key and value are expected to be a string.
   dictionary                                  If new meta data is provided, or existing meta data is modified, the config will be updated by removing it and creating it again.

   integer        60                           If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable DOCKER_TIMEOUT will be used instead. If the environment variable is not
                                               set, the default value will be used.
                    Choices:                   Secure the connection to the API by using TLS without verifying the authenticity of the Docker host server. Note that if validate_certs is set to yes

NOTES                   *docker_config-notes*

   Note

     • Connect to the Docker daemon by providing parameters with each task or by defining environment variables. You can define DOCKER_HOST, DOCKER_TLS_HOSTNAME, DOCKER_API_VERSION,
       DOCKER_CERT_PATH, DOCKER_SSL_VERSION, DOCKER_TLS, DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY and DOCKER_TIMEOUT. If you are using docker machine, run the script shipped with the product that sets up the environment.
       It will set these variables for you. See https://docs.docker.com/machine/reference/env/ for more details.
     • When connecting to Docker daemon with TLS, you might need to install additional Python packages. For the Docker SDK for Python, version 2.4 or newer, this can be done by installing
       docker[tls] with pip.
     • Note that the Docker SDK for Python only allows to specify the path to the Docker configuration for very few functions. In general, it will use $HOME/.docker/config.json if the DOCKER_CONFIG
       environment variable is not specified, and use $DOCKER_CONFIG/config.json otherwise.

EXAMPLES                   *docker_config-examples*

 - name: Create config foo (from a file on the control machine)
   docker_config:
     name: foo
     # If the file is JSON or binary, Ansible might modify it (because
     # it is first decoded and later re-encoded). Base64-encoding the
     # file directly after reading it prevents this to happen.
     data: "{{ lookup('file', '/path/to/config/file') | b64encode }}"
     data_is_b64: true
     state: present

 - name: Change the config data
   docker_config:
     name: foo
     data: Goodnight everyone!
     labels:
       bar: baz
       one: '1'
     state: present

 - name: Add a new label
   docker_config:
     name: foo
     data: Goodnight everyone!
     labels:
       bar: baz
       one: '1'
       # Adding a new label will cause a remove/create of the config
       two: '2'
     state: present

 - name: No change
   docker_config:
     name: foo
     data: Goodnight everyone!
     labels:
       bar: baz
       one: '1'
       # Even though 'two' is missing, there is no change to the existing config
     state: present

 - name: Update an existing label
   docker_config:
     name: foo
     data: Goodnight everyone!
     labels:
       bar: monkey   # Changing a label will cause a remove/create of the config
       one: '1'
     state: present

 - name: Force the (re-)creation of the config
   docker_config:
     name: foo
     data: Goodnight everyone!
     force: yes
     state: present

 - name: Remove config foo
   docker_config:
     name: foo
     state: absent
