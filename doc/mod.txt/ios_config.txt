SYNOPSIS                   *ios_config*

     • Cisco IOS configurations use a simple block indent file syntax for segmenting configuration into sections. This module provides an implementation for working with IOS configuration sections
       in a deterministic way.

   after                                The ordered set of commands to append to the end of the command stack if a change needs to be made. Just like with before this allows the playbook designer
   -                                    to append a set of commands to be executed after the command set.

                                        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using connection: network_cli and become: yes with become_pass.

                                        Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device. If authorize is false, then this argument does nothing. If the value
                                        is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS will be used instead.

                                        Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands. If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all
                                        commands in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE will be used instead.
   backup                Choices:       This argument will cause the module to create a full backup of the current running-config from the remote device before any changes are made. If the
   boolean               • no ←         backup_options value is not given, the backup file is written to the backup folder in the playbook root directory or role root directory, if playbook is part
                         • yes          of an ansible role. If the directory does not exist, it is created.
   backup_options                       This is a dict object containing configurable options related to backup file path. The value of this option is read only when backup is set to yes, if backup
   dictionary                           is set to no this option will be silently ignored.
   added in 2.8
                                        This option provides the path ending with directory name in which the backup configuration file will be stored. If the directory does not exist it will be
        dir_path                        first created and the filename is either the value of filename or default filename as described in filename options description. If the path value is not
        path                            given in that case a backup directory will be created in the current working directory and backup configuration will be copied in filename within backup
                                        directory.
        filename                        The filename to be used to store the backup configuration. If the the filename is not given it will be generated based on the hostname, current time and date

   before                               The ordered set of commands to push on to the command stack if a change needs to be made. This allows the playbook designer the opportunity to perform
   -                                    configuration commands prior to pushing any changes without affecting how the set of commands are matched against the system.
   defaults              Choices:       This argument specifies whether or not to collect all defaults when getting the remote device running config. When enabled, the module will get the current

                         • yes
                                        When using the ansible-playbook --diff command line argument the module can generate diffs against different sources.
   diff_against          Choices:       When this option is configure as startup, the module will return the diff of the running-config against the startup-config.
   -                     • running      When this option is configured as intended, the module will return the diff of the running-config against the configuration provided in the intended_config

                         • intended     When this option is configured as running, the module will return the before and after diff of the running-config with respect to any changes made to the

   diff_ignore_lines                    Use this argument to specify one or more lines that should be ignored during the diff. This is used for lines in the configuration that are automatically

   intended_config                      The intended_config provides the master configuration that the node should conform to and is used to check the final running-config against. This argument
   -                                    will not modify any settings on the remote device and is strictly used to check the compliance of the current device's configuration against. When specifying

   lines                                The ordered set of commands that should be configured in the section. The commands must be the exact same commands as found in the device running-config. Be

   multiline_delimiter Default:         This argument is used when pushing a multiline configuration element to the IOS device. It specifies the character to use as the delimiting character. This
