NOTES                   *tower_receive-notes*

   Note

     • Specifying a name of “all” for any asset type will export all items of that asset type.
     • If no config_file is provided we will attempt to use the tower-cli library defaults to find your Tower host information.
     • config_file should contain Tower configuration in the following format host=hostname username=username password=password
