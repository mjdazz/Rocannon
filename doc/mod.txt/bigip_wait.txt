SYNOPSIS                   *bigip_wait*

     • You can wait for BIG-IP to be “ready”. By “ready”, we mean that BIG-IP is ready to accept configuration.
     • This module can take into account situations where the device is in the middle of rebooting due to a configuration change.

NOTES                   *bigip_wait-notes*

   Note

     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
