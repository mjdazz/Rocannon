   hostname                           IP address or hostname of Cisco UCS Manager.
   string / required
   last_uuid                          The last UUID in the block of UUIDs.
   -                                  This is the To field in the UCS Manager Add UUID Blocks menu.

                                      sequential - Cisco UCS Manager selects the lowest available identity from the pool.
   org_dn            Default:         The distinguished name (dn) of the organization where the resource is assigned.
