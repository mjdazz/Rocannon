NOTES                   *bigiq_application_fastl4_udp-notes*

   Note

     • This module does not support updating of your application (whether deployed or not). If you need to update the application, the recommended practice is to remove and re-create.
     • This module will not work on BIGIQ version 6.1.x or greater.
     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
