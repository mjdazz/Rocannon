SYNOPSIS                   *include_role*

     • Dynamically loads and executes a specified role as a task.
     • May be used only where Ansible tasks are allowed - inside pre_tasks, tasks, or post_tasks playbook objects, or as a task inside a role.
     • Task-level keywords, loops, and conditionals apply only to the include_role statement itself.
     • To apply keywords to the tasks within the role, pass them using the apply option or use import_role instead.
     • Ignores some keywords, like until and retries.
     • This module is also supported for Windows targets.

NOTES                   *include_role-notes*

   Note

     • Handlers are made available to the whole play.
     • Before Ansible 2.4, as with include, this task could be static or dynamic, If static, it implied that it won’t need templating, loops or conditionals and will show included tasks in the
       --list options. Ansible would try to autodetect what is needed, but you can set static to yes or no at task level to control this.
     • After Ansible 2.4, you can use import_role for static behaviour and this action for dynamic one.
