PARAMETERS                   *ucs_vlans-parameters*

       Parameter     Choices/Defaults                                                                            Comments
                       Choices:       The fabric configuration of the VLAN. This can be one of the following:
   fabric              • common ←     common - The VLAN applies to both fabrics and uses the same configuration parameters in both cases.
   -                   • A            A — The VLAN only applies to fabric A.
                       • B            B — The VLAN only applies to fabric B.
                                      For upstream disjoint L2 networks, Cisco recommends that you choose common to create VLANs that apply to both fabrics.
   hostname                           IP address or hostname of Cisco UCS Manager.
   string / required
                                      The unique string identifier assigned to the VLAN.
                                      A VLAN ID can be between '1' and '3967', or between '4048' and '4093'.
   id                                 You cannot create VLANs with IDs from 4030 to 4047. This range of VLAN IDs is reserved.
   - / required                       The VLAN IDs you specify must also be supported on the switch that you are using.
                                      VLANs in the LAN cloud and FCoE VLANs in the SAN cloud must have different IDs.
                                      Optional if state is absent.
   multicast_policy  Default:         The multicast policy associated with this VLAN.
   -                 ""               This option is only valid if the Sharing Type field is set to None or Primary.
                                      The name assigned to the VLAN.
   name                               The VLAN name is case sensitive.
   - / required                       This name can be between 1 and 32 alphanumeric characters.
                                      You cannot use spaces or any special characters other than - (hyphen), "_" (underscore), : (colon), and . (period).
                                      You cannot change this name after the VLAN is created.
   native              Choices:
   -                   • yes          Designates the VLAN as a native VLAN.

   sharing             • primary      none - This VLAN does not have any secondary or private VLANs. This is a regular VLAN.
   -                   • isolated     primary - This VLAN can have one or more secondary VLANs, as shown in the Secondary VLANs area. This VLAN is a primary VLAN in the private VLAN domain.
                       • community    isolated - This is a private VLAN associated with a primary VLAN. This VLAN is an Isolated VLAN.
                                      community - This VLAN can communicate with other ports on the same community VLAN as well as the promiscuous port. This VLAN is a Community VLAN.
   state               Choices:       If present, will verify VLANs are present and will create if needed.
   -                   • present ←    If absent, will verify VLANs are absent and will delete if needed.
