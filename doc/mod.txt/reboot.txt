SYNOPSIS                   *reboot*

     • Reboot a machine, wait for it to go down, come back up, and respond to commands.
     • For Windows targets, use the win_reboot module instead.

PARAMETERS                   *reboot-parameters*

       Parameter      Choices/Defaults                                                                            Comments
   connect_timeout                      Maximum seconds to wait for a successful connection to the managed hosts before trying again.
   integer                              If unspecified, the default setting for the underlying connection plugin is used.
   msg               Default:
   string            "Reboot initiated  Message to display to users before reboot.
                     by Ansible"
   post_reboot_delay Default:           Seconds to wait after the reboot command was successful before attempting to validate the system rebooted successfully.
   integer           0                  This is useful if you want wait for something to settle despite your connection already working.
   pre_reboot_delay  Default:           Seconds to wait before reboot. Passed as a parameter to the reboot command.
   integer           0                  On Linux, macOS and OpenBSD, this is converted to minutes and rounded down. If less than 60, it will be set to 0.
                                        On Solaris and FreeBSD, this will be seconds.
   reboot_timeout    Default:           Maximum seconds to wait for machine to reboot and respond to a test command.
   integer           600                This timeout is evaluated separately for both reboot verification and test command success so the maximum execution time for the module is twice this amount.
   search_paths      Default:
   list              ["/sbin",          Paths to search on the remote machine for the shutdown command.
   added in 2.8      "/usr/sbin",       Only these paths will be searched for the shutdown command. PATH is ignored in the remote node when searching for the shutdown command.
                     "/usr/local/sbin"]
   test_command      Default:           Command to run on the rebooted host and expect success from to determine the machine is ready for further tasks.
   string            "whoami"

NOTES                   *reboot-notes*

   Note

     • PATH is ignored on the remote node when searching for the shutdown command. Use search_paths to specify locations to search if the default paths do not work.
