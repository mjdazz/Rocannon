NOTES                   *hg-notes*

   Note

     • This module does not support push capability. See https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/31156.
     • If the task seems to be hanging, first verify remote host is in known_hosts. SSH will prompt user to authorize the first contact with a remote host. To avoid this prompt, one solution is to
       add the remote host public key in /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts before calling the hg module, with the following command: ssh-keyscan remote_host.com >> /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts.
     • As per 01 Dec 2018, Bitbucket has dropped support for TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 connections. As such, if the underlying system still uses a Python version below 2.7.9, you will have issues checking
       out bitbucket repositories. See https://bitbucket.org/blog/deprecating-tlsv1-tlsv1-1-2018-12-01.

EXAMPLES                   *hg-examples*

   hg:
     repo: https://bitbucket.org/user/repo1
     dest: /home/user/repo1
     revision: stable
     purge: yes

 - name: Get information about the repository whether or not it has already been cloned locally.
   hg:
     repo: git://bitbucket.org/user/repo
     dest: /srv/checkout
     clone: no
     update: no
