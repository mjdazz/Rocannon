NOTES                   *vmware_guest-notes*

   Note

     • Please make sure that the user used for vmware_guest has the correct level of privileges.
     • For example, following is the list of minimum privileges required by users to create virtual machines.
     • DataStore > Allocate Space
     • Virtual Machine > Configuration > Add New Disk
     • Virtual Machine > Configuration > Add or Remove Device
     • Virtual Machine > Inventory > Create New
     • Network > Assign Network
     • Resource > Assign Virtual Machine to Resource Pool
     • Module may require additional privileges as well, which may be required for gathering facts - e.g. ESXi configurations.
     • Tested on vSphere 5.5, 6.0, 6.5 and 6.7
     • Use SCSI disks instead of IDE when you want to expand online disks by specifying a SCSI controller
