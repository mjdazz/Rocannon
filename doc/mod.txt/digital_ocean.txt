        Why:      Updated module to remove external dependency with increased functionality.
    Alternative:  Use digital_ocean_droplet instead.

NOTES                   *digital_ocean-notes*

   Note

     • Two environment variables can be used, DO_API_KEY and DO_API_TOKEN. They both refer to the v2 token.
     • As of Ansible 1.9.5 and 2.0, Version 2 of the DigitalOcean API is used, this removes client_id and api_key options in favor of api_token.
     • If you are running Ansible 1.9.4 or earlier you might not be able to use the included version of this module as the API version used has been retired. Upgrade Ansible or, if unable to, try
       downloading the latest version of this module from github and putting it into a ‘library’ directory.

 # Create a droplet with ssh key
 # The ssh key id can be passed as argument at the creation of a droplet (see ssh_key_ids).
 # Several keys can be added to ssh_key_ids as id1,id2,id3
 # The keys are used to connect as root to the droplet.
