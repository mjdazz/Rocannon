                                        A dict object containing connection details.
       auth_pass                        Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device. If authorize is false, then this argument does nothing. If the value
       -                                is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS will be used instead.
       authorize         Choices:       Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands. If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all
       boolean           • no ←         commands in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE will be used instead.
                         • yes
       host                             Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport. The value of host is used as the destination address
       - / required                     for the transport.
       password                         Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not
       -                                specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD will be used instead.
       port            Default:         Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device.
       -               22
       ssh_keyfile                      Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is the path to the key used to authenticate the SSH session. If
       -                                the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILEwill be used instead.
       timeout         Default:         Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before the
       -               10               operation is completed, the module will error.
       username                         Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not
       -                                specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will be used instead.
                         Choices:
   state                 • present ←    Manage the state of the Layer-2 Interface configuration.
   -                     • absent
                         • unconfigured
   trunk_allowed_vlans                  List of allowed VLANs in a given trunk port. If mode=trunk, these are the only VLANs that will be configured on the trunk, i.e. "2-10,15".
   -
   trunk_vlans                          List of VLANs to be configured in trunk port. If mode=trunk, used as the VLAN range to ADD or REMOVE from the trunk.
