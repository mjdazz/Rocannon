                                             The goal of default disk is to define what kind of disk is supported by the OS mainly in terms of bus (ide, scsi, sata, virtio, ...)
   default_disk                              The default_disk parameter define configuration overlay for disks that will be applied on top of disks during virtual machine creation to define global
   dictionary                                compatibility and/or performance defaults defined here.
                                             This is parameter can be used only when kubevirt addon is installed on your openshift cluster.
                                             The goal of default network is similar to default_volume and should be used as a template that specifies performance and connection parameters (L2
   default_network                           bridge for example)
   dictionary                                The default_network parameter define configuration overlay for networks that will be applied on top of networks during virtual machine creation to
                                             define global compatibility and/or performance defaults defined here.

                                             The goal of default network is similar to default_disk and should be used as a template to ensure OS compatibility and performance.
   default_nic                               The default_nic parameter define configuration overlay for nic that will be applied on top of nics during virtual machine creation to define global
   dictionary                                compatibility and/or performance defaults defined here.
                                             This is parameter can be used only when kubevirt addon is installed on your openshift cluster.
                                             The goal of default volume is to be able to configure mostly performance parameters like caches if those are exposed by the underlying volume
   default_volume                            implementation.
   dictionary                                The default_volume parameter define configuration overlay for volumes that will be applied on top of volumes during virtual machine creation to define
                                             global compatibility and/or performance defaults defined here.
                                             This is parameter can be used only when kubevirt addon is installed on your openshift cluster.

   string                                    Include enough detail that the user will understand what is being deployed... and any caveats they need to know before deploying. It should also provide
                                             links to additional information, such as a README file."

   string
   editable                                  Extension for hinting at which elements should be considered editable. List of jsonpath selectors. The jsonpath root is the objects: element of the
   list                                      template.
                                             This is parameter can be used only when kubevirt addon is installed on your openshift cluster.
   force                   Choices:
   boolean                 • no ←            If set to yes, and state is present, an existing object will be replaced.

   host                                      Provide a URL for accessing the API. Can also be specified via K8S_AUTH_HOST environment variable.
   string
   icon_class                                An icon to be displayed with your template in the web console. Choose from our existing logo icons when possible. You can also use icons from
   string                                    FontAwesome. Alternatively, provide icons through CSS customizations that can be added to an OpenShift Container Platform cluster that uses your
                                             template. You must specify an icon class that exists, or it will prevent falling back to the generic icon.

                                             List of any valid API objects, such as a DeploymentConfig, Service, etc. The object will be created exactly as defined here, with any parameter values
   objects                                   substituted in prior to creation. The definition of these objects can reference parameters defined earlier.
   list                                      As part of the the list user can pass also VirtualMachine kind. When passing VirtualMachine user must use Ansible structure of the parameters not the
                                             Kubernetes API structure. For more information please take a look at kubevirt_vm module and at EXAMPLES section, where you can see example.
                                             Parameters allow a value to be supplied by the user or generated when the template is instantiated. Then, that value is substituted wherever the
   parameters                                parameter is referenced. References can be defined in any field in the objects list field. This is useful for generating random passwords or allowing
   list                                      the user to supply a host name or other user-specific value that is required to customize the template.

   state                   Choices:          Determines if an object should be created, patched, or deleted. When set to present, an object will be created, if it does not already exist. If set to
   string                  • absent          absent, an existing object will be deleted. If set to present, an existing object will be patched, if its attributes differ from those specified using

   string                                    Please note that this only works with clusters configured to use HTTP Basic Auth. If your cluster has a different form of authentication (e.g. OAuth2 in
                                             OpenShift), this option will not work as expected and you should look into the k8s_auth module, as that might do what you need.

   string                                    This is parameter can be used only when kubevirt addon is installed on your openshift cluster.

NOTES                   *kubevirt_template-notes*

   Note

     • The OpenShift Python client wraps the K8s Python client, providing full access to all of the APIS and models available on both platforms. For API version details and additional information
       visit https://github.com/openshift/openshift-restclient-python
     • To avoid SSL certificate validation errors when validate_certs is True, the full certificate chain for the API server must be provided via ca_cert or in the kubeconfig file.
