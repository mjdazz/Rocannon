                                      present implies that the database should be created if necessary.
                       Choices:       absent implies that the database should be removed if present.
                       • absent       dump requires a target definition to which the database will be backed up. (Added in Ansible 2.4) Note that in some PostgreSQL versions of pg_dump, which is an
   state               • dump         embedded PostgreSQL utility and is used by the module, returns rc 0 even when errors occurred (e.g. the connection is forbidden by pg_hba.conf, etc.), so the
   string              • present ←    module returns changed=True but the dump has not actually been done. Please, be sure that your version of pg_dump returns rc 1 in this case.
                       • restore      restore also requires a target definition from which the database will be restored. (Added in Ansible 2.4)
                                      The format of the backup will be detected based on the target name.
                                      Supported compression formats for dump and restore include .bz2, .gz and .xz
                                      Supported formats for dump and restore include .sql and .tar

NOTES                   *postgresql_db-notes*

   Note

     • State dump and restore don’t require psycopg2 since version 2.8.
     • The default authentication assumes that you are either logging in as or sudo’ing to the postgres account on the host.
     • To avoid “Peer authentication failed for user postgres” error, use postgres user as a become_user.
     • This module uses psycopg2, a Python PostgreSQL database adapter. You must ensure that psycopg2 is installed on the host before using this module.
     • If the remote host is the PostgreSQL server (which is the default case), then PostgreSQL must also be installed on the remote host.
     • For Ubuntu-based systems, install the postgresql, libpq-dev, and python-psycopg2 packages on the remote host before using this module.
     • The ca_cert parameter requires at least Postgres version 8.4 and psycopg2 version 2.4.3.

EXAMPLES                   *postgresql_db-examples*

 - name: Create a new database with name "acme"
   postgresql_db:
     name: acme

 # Note: If a template different from "template0" is specified, encoding and locale settings must match those of the template.
 - name: Create a new database with name "acme" and specific encoding and locale # settings.
   postgresql_db:
     name: acme
     encoding: UTF-8
     lc_collate: de_DE.UTF-8
     lc_ctype: de_DE.UTF-8
     template: template0

 # Note: Default limit for the number of concurrent connections to a specific database is "-1", which means "unlimited"
 - name: Create a new database with name "acme" which has a limit of 100 concurrent connections
   postgresql_db:
     name: acme
     conn_limit: "100"

 - name: Dump an existing database to a file
   postgresql_db:
     name: acme
     state: dump
     target: /tmp/acme.sql

 - name: Dump an existing database to a file (with compression)
   postgresql_db:
     name: acme
     state: dump
     target: /tmp/acme.sql.gz

 - name: Dump a single schema for an existing database
   postgresql_db:
     name: acme
     state: dump
     target: /tmp/acme.sql
     target_opts: "-n public"

 # Note: In the example below, if database foo exists and has another tablespace
 # the tablespace will be changed to foo. Access to the database will be locked
 # until the copying of database files is finished.
 - name: Create a new database called foo in tablespace bar
   postgresql_db:
     name: foo
     tablespace: bar
