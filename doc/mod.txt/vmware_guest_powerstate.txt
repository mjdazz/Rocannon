                                                  Scheduling task requires vCenter server. A standalone ESXi server does not support this option.

   integer                   0                    If this argument is set to a positive integer, the module will instead wait for the VM to reach the poweredoff state.
   added in 2.6                                   The value sets a timeout in seconds for the module to wait for the state change.
   use_instance_uuid           Choices:
   boolean                     • no ←             Whether to use the VMware instance UUID rather than the BIOS UUID.

   uuid                                           UUID of the instance to manage if known, this is VMware's unique identifier.
   string                                         This is required if name or moid is not supplied.
                               Choices:           Allows connection when SSL certificates are not valid. Set to false when certificates are not trusted.
