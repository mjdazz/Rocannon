NOTES                   *bigip_snat_pool-notes*

   Note

     • When bigip_snat_pool object is removed it also removes any associated bigip_snat_translation objects.
     • This is a BIG-IP behavior not module behavior and it only occurs when the bigip_snat_translation objects are also not referenced by another bigip_snat_pool.
     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
