EXAMPLES                   *github_hooks-examples*

 # Example creating a new service hook. It ignores duplicates.
 - github_hooks:
     action: create
     hookurl: http://11.111.111.111:2222
     user: '{{ gituser }}'
     oauthkey: '{{ oauthkey }}'
     repo: https://api.github.com/repos/pcgentry/Github-Auto-Deploy

 # Cleaning all hooks for this repo that had an error on the last update. Since this works for all hooks in a repo it is probably best that this would
 # be called from a handler.
 - github_hooks:
     action: cleanall
     user: '{{ gituser }}'
     oauthkey: '{{ oauthkey }}'
     repo: '{{ repo }}'
   delegate_to: localhost
