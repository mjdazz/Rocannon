NOTES                   *sendgrid-notes*

   Note

     • This module is non-idempotent because it sends an email through the external API. It is idempotent only in the case that the module fails.
     • Like the other notification modules, this one requires an external dependency to work. In this case, you’ll need an active SendGrid account.
     • In order to use api_key, cc, bcc, attachments, from_name, html_body, headers you must pip install sendgrid
     • since 2.2 username and password are not required if you supply an api_key
