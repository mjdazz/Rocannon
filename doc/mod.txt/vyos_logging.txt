                                 A dict object containing connection details.
    host                         Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport. The value of host is used as the destination address for
    string /                     the transport.
    required
    password                     Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not specified
    string                       in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD will be used instead.
    port        Default:         Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device.
    integer     22
    ssh_keyfile                  Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is the path to the key used to authenticate the SSH session. If the
    path                         value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE will be used instead.
