SYNOPSIS                   *gcp_compute_snapshot*

     • Represents a Persistent Disk Snapshot resource.
     • Use snapshots to back up data from your persistent disks. Snapshots are different from public images and custom images, which are used primarily to create instances or configure instance
       templates. Snapshots are useful for periodic backup of the data on your persistent disks. You can create snapshots from persistent disks even while they are attached to running instances.
     • Snapshots are incremental, so you can create regular snapshots on a persistent disk faster and at a much lower cost than if you regularly created a full image of the disk.
