SYNOPSIS                   *bigip_profile_udp*

     • Manage UDP profiles on a BIG-IP. Many of UDP profiles exist; each with their own adjustments to the standard udp profile. Users of this module should be aware that many of the adjustable
       knobs have no module default. Instead, the default is assigned by the BIG-IP system itself which, in most cases, is acceptable.

PARAMETERS                   *bigip_profile_udp-parameters*

          Parameter        Choices/Defaults                                                                         Comments
   datagram_load_balancing   Choices:
   boolean                   • no           Specifies, when yes, that the system load balances UDP traffic packet-by-packet.
                             • yes
                                            Specifies the length of time that a connection is idle (has no traffic) before the connection is eligible for deletion.
                                            When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the remote device will choose a default value appropriate for the profile, based on its
   idle_timeout                             parent profile.
   string                                   When a number is specified, indicates the number of seconds that the UDP connection can remain idle before the system deletes it.
                                            When 0, or indefinite, specifies that UDP connections can remain idle indefinitely.
                                            When immediate, specifies that you do not want the UDP connection to remain idle, and that it is therefore immediately eligible for deletion.
   name                                     Specifies the name of the profile.
   string / required
   parent                                   Specifies the profile from which this profile inherits settings.
   string                                   When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is the system-supplied udp profile.
   partition               Default:         Device partition to manage resources on.
   string                  "Common"
   provider
   dictionary                               A dict object containing connection details.

       auth_provider                        Configures the auth provider for to obtain authentication tokens from the remote device.
       string                               This option is really used when working with BIG-IQ devices.
       password                             The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP.
       string / required                    You may omit this option by setting the environment variable F5_PASSWORD.
                                            aliases: pass, pwd
       server                               The BIG-IP host.
       string / required                    You may omit this option by setting the environment variable F5_SERVER.
       server_port         Default:         The BIG-IP server port.
       integer             443              You may omit this option by setting the environment variable F5_SERVER_PORT.
       ssh_keyfile                          Specifies the SSH keyfile to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This argument is only used for cli transports.
       path                                 You may omit this option by setting the environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE.
       timeout                              Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before
       integer                              the operation is completed, the module will error.

NOTES                   *bigip_profile_udp-notes*

   Note

     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
