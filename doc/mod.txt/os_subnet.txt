         Parameter          Choices/Defaults                                                                          Comments
   allocation_pool_end                         From the subnet pool the last IP that should be assigned to the virtual machines.
   -
   allocation_pool_start                       From the subnet pool the starting address from which the IP should be allocated.
   -
   api_timeout                                 How long should the socket layer wait before timing out for API calls. If this is omitted, nothing will be passed to the requests library.
   integer
                                               Dictionary containing auth information as needed by the cloud's auth plugin strategy. For the default password plugin, this would contain auth_url,
   auth                                        username, password, project_name and any information about domains (for example, os_user_domain_name or os_project_domain_name) if the cloud supports
   dictionary                                  them. For other plugins, this param will need to contain whatever parameters that auth plugin requires. This parameter is not needed if a named cloud
                                               is provided or OpenStack OS_" environment variables are present.
   auth_type                                   Name of the auth plugin to use. If the cloud uses something other than password authentication, the name of the plugin should be indicated here and
   string                                      the contents of the auth parameter should be updated accordingly.
   availability_zone                           Ignored. Present for backwards compatibility
   -
   ca_cert                                     A path to a CA Cert bundle that can be used as part of verifying SSL API requests.
   string                                      aliases: cacert
   cidr                                        The CIDR representation of the subnet that should be assigned to the subnet. Required when state is 'present' and a subnetpool is not specified.
   -
   client_cert                                 A path to a client certificate to use as part of the SSL transaction.
   string                                      aliases: cert
   client_key                                  A path to a client key to use as part of the SSL transaction.
   string                                      aliases: key
   cloud                                       Named cloud or cloud config to operate against. If cloud is a string, it references a named cloud config as defined in an OpenStack clouds.yaml file.
   raw                                         Provides default values for auth and auth_type. This parameter is not needed if auth is provided or if OpenStack OS_" environment variables are
                                               present. If cloud is a dict, it contains a complete cloud configuration like would be in a section of clouds.yaml.

NOTES                   *os_subnet-notes*

   Note

     • The standard OpenStack environment variables, such as OS_USERNAME may be used instead of providing explicit values.
     • Auth information is driven by openstacksdk, which means that values can come from a yaml config file in /etc/ansible/openstack.yaml, /etc/openstack/clouds.yaml or
       ~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml, then from standard environment variables, then finally by explicit parameters in plays. More information can be found at
       https://docs.openstack.org/openstacksdk/
