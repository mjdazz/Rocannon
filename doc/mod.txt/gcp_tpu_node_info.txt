NOTES                   *gcp_tpu_node_info-notes*

   Note

     • for authentication, you can set service_account_file using the c(gcp_service_account_file) env variable.
     • for authentication, you can set service_account_contents using the c(GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CONTENTS) env variable.
     • For authentication, you can set service_account_email using the GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL env variable.
     • For authentication, you can set auth_kind using the GCP_AUTH_KIND env variable.
     • For authentication, you can set scopes using the GCP_SCOPES env variable.
     • Environment variables values will only be used if the playbook values are not set.
     • The service_account_email and service_account_file options are mutually exclusive.

EXAMPLES                   *gcp_tpu_node_info-examples*

 - name: get info on a node
   gcp_tpu_node_info:
     zone: us-central1-b
     project: test_project
     auth_kind: serviceaccount
     service_account_file: "/tmp/auth.pem"

RETURN VALUES                   *gcp_tpu_node_info-return values*

   Common return values are documented here, the following are the fields unique to this module:

           Key         Returned                                                                              Description
   resources           always   List of resources
   complex
     acceleratorType   success  The type of hardware accelerators associated with this node.
     string
                                The CIDR block that the TPU node will use when selecting an IP address. This CIDR block must be a /29 block; the Compute Engine networks API forbids a smaller block,
     cidrBlock         success  and using a larger block would be wasteful (a node can only consume one IP address).
     string                     Errors will occur if the CIDR block has already been used for a currently existing TPU node, the CIDR block conflicts with any subnetworks in the user's provided
                                network, or the provided network is peered with another network that is using that CIDR block.
     description       success  The user-supplied description of the TPU. Maximum of 512 characters.
     string
     labels            success  Resource labels to represent user provided metadata.
     dictionary
     name              success  The immutable name of the TPU.
     string
     network           success  The name of a network to peer the TPU node to. It must be a preexisting Compute Engine network inside of the project on which this API has been activated. If none is
     string                     provided, "default" will be used.
     networkEndpoints  success  The network endpoints where TPU workers can be accessed and sent work.
     complex                    It is recommended that Tensorflow clients of the node first reach out to the first (index 0) entry.
          ipAddress    success  The IP address of this network endpoint.
          string
          port         success  The port of this network endpoint.
          integer
     schedulingConfig  success  Sets the scheduling options for this TPU instance.
     complex
          preemptible  success  Defines whether the TPU instance is preemptible.
          boolean
     serviceAccount    success  The service account used to run the tensor flow services within the node. To share resources, including Google Cloud Storage data, with the Tensorflow job running in
     string                     the Node, this account must have permissions to that data.
     tensorflowVersion success  The version of Tensorflow running in the Node.
     string
     zone              success  The GCP location for the TPU.
     string
