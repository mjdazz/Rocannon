     • Manages Fast L4 profiles.

PARAMETERS                   *bigip_profile_fastl4-parameters*

          Parameter        Choices/Defaults                                                                         Comments
                                            Specifies a timeout for Late Binding.
                                            This is the time limit for the client to provide the application data required to select a back-end server. That is, this is the maximum time that the
   client_timeout                           BIG-IP system waits for information about the sender and the target.
   string                                   This information typically arrives at the beginning of the FIX logon packet.
                                            When 0, or immediate, allows for no time beyond the moment of the first packet transmission.
                                            When indefinite, disables the limit. This allows the client unlimited time to send the sender and target information.
   description                              Description of the profile.
   string
                             Choices:       Specifies whether a qualified late-binding connection requires an explicit iRule command to migrate down to ePVA hardware.
   explicit_flow_migration   • no           When no, a late-binding connection migrates down to ePVA immediately after establishing the server-side connection.
   boolean                   • yes          When yes, this parameter stops automatic migration to ePVA, and requires that the iRule explicitly trigger ePVA processing by invoking the release_flow
                                            iRule command. This allows an iRule author to control when the connection uses the ePVA hardware.
                                            Specifies the length of time that a connection is idle (has no traffic) before the connection is eligible for deletion.
                                            When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the remote device will choose a default value appropriate for the profile, based on its

                                            When 0, or immediate, specifies that the system deletes connections immediately when they become idle.

                                            When mimic, specifies that the system sets the ToS level of outgoing packets to the same ToS level of the most-recently received incoming packet.
                                            Specifies, for IP traffic passing through the system to back-end servers, whether the system modifies the IP type-of-service (ToS) setting in an IP
