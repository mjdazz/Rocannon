SYNOPSIS                   *win_file*

     • Creates (empty) files, updates file modification stamps of existing files, and can create or remove directories.
     • Unlike file, does not modify ownership, permissions or manipulate links.
     • For non-Windows targets, use the file module instead.

   string      • directory    deleted, and files will be removed.
               • file         If touch, an empty file will be created if the path does not exist, while an existing file or directory will receive updated file access and modification times
               • touch        (similar to the way touch works from the command line).
