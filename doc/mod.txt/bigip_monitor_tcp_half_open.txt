   integer                                 the default value will be 5. This value must be less than the timeout value.
   ip                                      IP address part of the IP/port definition. If this parameter is not provided when creating a new monitor, then the default value will be '"'.

    timeout                                Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before
    integer                                the operation is completed, the module will error.
    transport        Choices:
    string           • cli                 Configures the transport connection to use when connecting to the remote device.

                     • yes ←
   state             Choices:              When present, ensures that the monitor exists.
   string            • present ←           When absent, ensures the monitor is removed.
   added in 2.5      • absent
   time_until_up                           Specifies the amount of time in seconds after the first successful response before a node will be marked up. A value of 0 will cause a node to be marked
   integer                                 up immediately after a valid response is received from the node. If this parameter is not provided when creating a new monitor, then the default value
                                           will be 0.
                                           The number of seconds in which the node or service must respond to the monitor request. If the target responds within the set time period, it is
   timeout                                 considered up. If the target does not respond within the set time period, it is considered down. You can change this number to any number you want,
   integer                                 however, it should be 3 times the interval number of seconds plus 1 second. If this parameter is not provided when creating a new monitor, then the
                                           default value will be 16.

NOTES                   *bigip_monitor_tcp_half_open-notes*

   Note

     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12
     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
