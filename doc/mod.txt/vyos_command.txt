SYNOPSIS                   *vyos_command*

     • The command module allows running one or more commands on remote devices running VyOS. This module can also be introspected to validate key parameters before returning successfully. If the
       conditional statements are not met in the wait period, the task fails.
     • Certain show commands in VyOS produce many lines of output and use a custom pager that can cause this module to hang. If the value of the environment variable ANSIBLE_VYOS_TERMINAL_LENGTH is
       not set, the default number of 10000 is used.

PARAMETERS                   *vyos_command-parameters*

    Parameter   Choices/Defaults                                                                               Comments
   commands                      The ordered set of commands to execute on the remote device running VyOS. The output from the command execution is returned to the playbook. If the wait_for
   - / required                  argument is provided, the module is not returned until the condition is satisfied or the number of retries has been exceeded.
   interval     Default:         Configures the interval in seconds to wait between retries of the command. If the command does not pass the specified conditions, the interval indicates how long to
   -            1                wait before trying the command again.
   match          Choices:       The match argument is used in conjunction with the wait_for argument to specify the match policy. Valid values are all or any. If the value is set to all then all
   -              • any          conditionals in the wait_for must be satisfied. If the value is set to any then only one of the values must be satisfied.

                                 A dict object containing connection details.
    host                         Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport. The value of host is used as the destination address for
    string /                     the transport.
    required
    password                     Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not specified
    string                       in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD will be used instead.
    port        Default:         Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device.
    integer     22
    ssh_keyfile                  Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is the path to the key used to authenticate the SSH session. If the
    path                         value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE will be used instead.
    timeout     Default:         Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before the
    integer     10               operation is completed, the module will error.
    username                     Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not
    string                       specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will be used instead.
   retries      Default:         Specifies the number of retries a command should be tried before it is considered failed. The command is run on the target device every retry and evaluated against
   -            10               the wait_for conditionals.
   wait_for                      Specifies what to evaluate from the output of the command and what conditionals to apply. This argument will cause the task to wait for a particular conditional to
   -                             be true before moving forward. If the conditional is not true by the configured retries, the task fails. See examples.

NOTES                   *vyos_command-notes*

   Note

     • Tested against VyOS 1.1.8 (helium).
     • Running show system boot-messages all will cause the module to hang since VyOS is using a custom pager setting to display the output of that command.
     • If a command sent to the device requires answering a prompt, it is possible to pass a dict containing command, answer and prompt. See examples.
     • This module works with connection network_cli. See the VyOS OS Platform Options.
     • For more information on using Ansible to manage network devices see the Ansible Network Guide
