NOTES                   *gcp_cloudtasks_queue_info-notes*

   Note

     • for authentication, you can set service_account_file using the c(gcp_service_account_file) env variable.
     • for authentication, you can set service_account_contents using the c(GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CONTENTS) env variable.
     • For authentication, you can set service_account_email using the GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL env variable.
     • For authentication, you can set auth_kind using the GCP_AUTH_KIND env variable.
     • For authentication, you can set scopes using the GCP_SCOPES env variable.
     • Environment variables values will only be used if the playbook values are not set.

RETURN VALUES                   *gcp_cloudtasks_queue_info-return values*

   resources                   always   List of resources
   complex
     appEngineRoutingOverride  success  Overrides for task-level appEngineRouting. These settings apply only to App Engine tasks in this queue .
     complex
       host                    success  The host that the task is sent to.
       string
       instance                success  App instance.
       string                           By default, the task is sent to an instance which is available when the task is attempted.
       service                 success  App service.
       string                           By default, the task is sent to the service which is the default service when the task is attempted.
       version                 success  App version.
       string                           By default, the task is sent to the version which is the default version when the task is attempted.
     location                  success  The location of the queue.
     string
     name                      success  The queue name.
     string
                                        Rate limits for task dispatches. The queue's actual dispatch rate is the result of: " Number of tasks in the queue " User-specified throttling: rateLimits,
     rateLimits                success  retryConfig, and the queue's state.
     complex                            " System throttling due to 429 (Too Many Requests) or 503 (Service Unavailable) responses from the worker, high error rates, or to smooth sudden large
                                        traffic spikes.
       maxBurstSize                     The max burst size.
       integer                 success  Max burst size limits how fast tasks in queue are processed when many tasks are in the queue and the rate is high. This field allows the queue to have a high
                                        rate so processing starts shortly after a task is enqueued, but still limits resource usage when many tasks are enqueued in a short period of time.
       maxConcurrentDispatches success  The maximum number of concurrent tasks that Cloud Tasks allows to be dispatched for this queue. After this threshold has been reached, Cloud Tasks stops
       integer                          dispatching tasks until the number of concurrent requests decreases.
       maxDispatchesPerSecond  success  The maximum rate at which tasks are dispatched from this queue.
       integer                          If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default.
     retryConfig               success  Settings that determine the retry behavior.
     complex
                                        Number of attempts per task.
       maxAttempts             success  Cloud Tasks will attempt the task maxAttempts times (that is, if the first attempt fails, then there will be maxAttempts - 1 retries). Must be >= -1.
       integer                          If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default.
                                        -1 indicates unlimited attempts.
       maxBackoff              success  A task will be scheduled for retry between minBackoff and maxBackoff duration after it fails, if the queue's RetryConfig specifies that the task should be
       string                           retried.
       maxDoublings                     The time between retries will double maxDoublings times.
       integer                 success  A task's retry interval starts at minBackoff, then doubles maxDoublings times, then increases linearly, and finally retries retries at intervals of
                                        maxBackoff up to maxAttempts times.
       maxRetryDuration                 If positive, maxRetryDuration specifies the time limit for retrying a failed task, measured from when the task was first attempted. Once maxRetryDuration
       string                  success  time has passed and the task has been attempted maxAttempts times, no further attempts will be made and the task will be deleted.
                                        If zero, then the task age is unlimited.
       minBackoff              success  A task will be scheduled for retry between minBackoff and maxBackoff duration after it fails, if the queue's RetryConfig specifies that the task should be
       string                           retried.
       purgeTime               success  The last time this queue was purged.
       string
     status                    success  The current state of the queue.
     string
