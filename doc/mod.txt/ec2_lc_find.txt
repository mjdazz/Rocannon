   aws_access_key                                AWS access key. If not set then the value of the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_ACCESS_KEY or EC2_ACCESS_KEY environment variable is used.
   string                                        aliases: ec2_access_key, access_key
   aws_secret_key                                AWS secret key. If not set then the value of the AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_SECRET_KEY, or EC2_SECRET_KEY environment variable is used.
   string                                        aliases: ec2_secret_key, secret_key
   debug_botocore_endpoint_logs   Choices:       Use a botocore.endpoint logger to parse the unique (rather than total) "resource:action" API calls made during a task, outputing the set to the
   boolean                        • no ←         resource_actions key in the task results. Use the aws_resource_action callback to output to total list made during a playbook. The
   added in 2.8                   • yes          ANSIBLE_DEBUG_BOTOCORE_LOGS environment variable may also be used.
   ec2_url                                       Url to use to connect to EC2 or your Eucalyptus cloud (by default the module will use EC2 endpoints). Ignored for modules where region is required.
   string                                        Must be specified for all other modules if region is not used. If not set then the value of the EC2_URL environment variable, if any, is used.
   limit                                         How many results to show.
   -                                             Corresponds to Python slice notation like list[:limit].
   name_regex                                    A Launch Configuration to match
   - / required                                  It'll be compiled as regex
   profile                                       Uses a boto profile. Only works with boto >= 2.24.0.
   string
   region                                        The AWS region to use.
   - / required                                  aliases: aws_region, ec2_region
   security_token                                AWS STS security token. If not set then the value of the AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN or EC2_SECURITY_TOKEN environment variable is used.
   string                                        aliases: access_token
   sort_order                     Choices:
   -                              • ascending ←  Order in which to sort results.
                                  • descending
   validate_certs                 Choices:
   boolean                        • no           When set to "no", SSL certificates will not be validated for boto versions >= 2.6.0.

NOTES                   *ec2_lc_find-notes*

   Note

     • If parameters are not set within the module, the following environment variables can be used in decreasing order of precedence AWS_URL or EC2_URL, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID or AWS_ACCESS_KEY or
       EC2_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY or AWS_SECRET_KEY or EC2_SECRET_KEY, AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN or EC2_SECURITY_TOKEN, AWS_REGION or EC2_REGION
     • Ansible uses the boto configuration file (typically ~/.boto) if no credentials are provided. See https://boto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/boto_config_tut.html
     • AWS_REGION or EC2_REGION can be typically be used to specify the AWS region, when required, but this can also be configured in the boto config file
