DEPRECATED                   *bigip_facts*

                                                                                          Removed in Ansible:
                  version: 2.11
        Why:      The bigip_facts module relies on SOAP to communicate with the BIG-IP, and has a large amount of code that does not conform to existing F5 standards. The bigip_device_info module
                  is easier to maintain and use.
    Alternative:  bigip_device_info

SYNOPSIS                   *bigip_facts-synopsis*

     • Collect facts from F5 BIG-IP devices via iControl SOAP API

REQUIREMENTS                   *bigip_facts-requirements*

   The below requirements are needed on the host that executes this module.

     • bigsuds

NOTES                   *bigip_facts-notes*

   Note

     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 11.4
     • F5 developed module ‘bigsuds’ required (see http://devcentral.f5.com)
     • Best run as a local_action in your playbook
     • Tested with manager and above account privilege level
     • provision facts were added in 2.2
     • This module is deprecated. Use the bigip_device_info module instead.
     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
