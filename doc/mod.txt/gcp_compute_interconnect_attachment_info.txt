     string                           partner. Of the form "XXXXX/region/domain" .
     partnerAsn              success  [Output only for type PARTNER. Not present for DEDICATED]. Optional BGP ASN for the router that should be supplied by a layer 3 Partner if they configured BGP
     string                           on behalf of the customer.

     string
     router                  success  URL of the cloud router to be used for dynamic routing. This router must be in the same region as this InterconnectAttachment. The InterconnectAttachment will
     dictionary                       automatically connect the Interconnect to the network & region within which the Cloud Router is configured.
     state                   success  [Output Only] The current state of this attachment's functionality.
     string
     type                    success  The type of InterconnectAttachment you wish to create. Defaults to DEDICATED.
     string
     vlanTag8021q            success  The IEEE 802.1Q VLAN tag for this attachment, in the range 2-4094. When using PARTNER type this will be managed upstream.
