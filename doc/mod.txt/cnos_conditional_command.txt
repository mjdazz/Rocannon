SYNOPSIS                   *cnos_conditional_command*

     • This module allows you to modify the running configuration of a switch. It provides a way to execute a single CNOS command on a network device by evaluating the current running configuration
       and executing the command only if the specific settings have not been already configured. The CNOS command is passed as an argument of the method. This module functions the same as the
       cnos_command module. The only exception is that following inventory variable can be specified [“condition = <flag string>”] When this inventory variable is specified as the variable of a
       task, the command is executed for the network element that matches the flag string. Usually, commands are executed across a group of network devices. When there is a requirement to skip the
       execution of the command on one or more devices, it is recommended to use this module. This module uses SSH to manage network device configuration.

     Parameter    Choices/Defaults                                                                              Comments
   clicommand     Default:         This specifies the CLI command as an attribute to this method. The command is passed using double quotes. The variables can be placed directly on to the CLI
   - / required   null             commands or can be invoked from the vars directory.
   condition      Default:         If you specify condition=false in the inventory file against any device, the command execution is skipped for that device.
   - / required   null
                    Choices:
                    • g8272_cnos
                    • g8296_cnos
   deviceType       • g8332_cnos
   string /         • NE0152T      This specifies the type of device where the method is executed. The choices NE1072T,NE1032,NE1032T,NE10032,NE2572 are added since Ansible 2.4. The choice NE0152T
   required         • NE1072T      is added since 2.8
                    • NE1032
                    • NE1032T
                    • NE10032
                    • NE2572
   enablePassword                  Configures the password used to enter Global Configuration command mode on the switch. If the switch does not request this password, the parameter is
   string                          ignored.While generally the value should come from the inventory file, you can also specify it as a variable. This parameter is optional. If it is not specified,
                                   no default value will be used.
   flag           Default:         If a task needs to be executed, you have to set the flag the same as it is specified in the inventory for that device.
   - / required   null
   host                            This is the variable used to search the hosts file at /etc/ansible/hosts and identify the IP address of the device on which the template is going to be applied.
   string /                        Usually the Ansible keyword {{ inventory_hostname }} is specified in the playbook as an abstraction of the group of network elements that need to be configured.
   required
   outputfile                      This specifies the file path where the output of each command execution is saved. Each command that is specified in the merged template file and each response
   string /                        from the device are saved here. Usually the location is the results folder, but you can choose another location based on your write permission.
   required
   password                        Configures the password used to authenticate the connection to the remote device. The value of the password parameter is used to authenticate the SSH session.
   string /                        While generally the value should come from the inventory file, you can also specify it as a variable. This parameter is optional. If it is not specified, no
   required                        default value will be used.
   username                        Configures the username used to authenticate the connection to the remote device. The value of the username parameter is used to authenticate the SSH session.
   string /                        While generally the value should come from the inventory file, you can also specify it as a variable. This parameter is optional. If it is not specified, no
   required                        default value will be used.
