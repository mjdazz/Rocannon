SYNOPSIS                   *gcp_compute_health_check*

     • Health Checks determine whether instances are responsive and able to do work.
     • They are an important part of a comprehensive load balancing configuration, as they enable monitoring instances behind load balancers.
     • Health Checks poll instances at a specified interval. Instances that do not respond successfully to some number of probes in a row are marked as unhealthy. No new connections are sent to
       unhealthy instances, though existing connections will continue. The health check will continue to poll unhealthy instances. If an instance later responds successfully to some number of
       consecutive probes, it is marked healthy again and can receive new connections.
