SYNOPSIS                   *bigip_iapp_service*

     • Manages TCL iApp services on a BIG-IP.
     • If you are looking for the API that is communicated with on the BIG-IP, the one the is used is /mgmt/tm/sys/application/service/.

PARAMETERS                   *bigip_iapp_service-parameters*

      Parameter    Choices/Defaults                                                                             Comments
   description                      Description of the iApp service.
   string                           If this option is specified in the Ansible task, it will take precedence over any similar setting in the iApp Service payload that you provide in the parameters
   added in 2.7                     field.
   device_group                     The device group for the iApp service.
   string                           If this option is specified in the Ansible task, it will take precedence over any similar setting in the iApp Service payload that you provide in the parameters
   added in 2.7                     field.
   force             Choices:       Forces the updating of an iApp service even if the parameters to the service have not changed. This option is of particular importance if the iApp template that
   boolean           • no ←         underlies the service has been updated in-place. This option is equivalent to re-configuring the iApp if that template has changed.
                     • yes
   metadata                         Metadata associated with the iApp service.
   list                             If this option is specified in the Ansible task, it will take precedence over any similar setting in the iApp Service payload that you provide in the parameters
   added in 2.7                     field.
   name
   string /                         The name of the iApp service that you want to deploy.
   required
   parameters                       A hash of all the required template variables for the iApp template. If your parameters are stored in a file (the more common scenario) it is recommended you use
   dictionary                       either the file or template lookups to supply the expected parameters.
                                    These parameters typically consist of the lists, tables, and variables fields.
   partition       Default:
   string          "Common"         Device partition to manage resources on.
   added in 2.5
   provider
   dictionary                       A dict object containing connection details.
   added in 2.5
    auth_provider                   Configures the auth provider for to obtain authentication tokens from the remote device.
    string                          This option is really used when working with BIG-IQ devices.

    string /                        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable F5_PASSWORD.
    required                        aliases: pass, pwd
    server                          The BIG-IP host.
    string /                        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable F5_SERVER.
    required
    server_port    Default:         The BIG-IP server port.
    integer        443              You may omit this option by setting the environment variable F5_SERVER_PORT.
    ssh_keyfile                     Specifies the SSH keyfile to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This argument is only used for cli transports.
    path                            You may omit this option by setting the environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE.
    timeout                         Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before the
    integer                         operation is completed, the module will error.
    transport        Choices:
    string           • cli          Configures the transport connection to use when connecting to the remote device.
                     • rest ←
    user                            The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device.
    string /                        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable F5_USER.
    required
    validate_certs   Choices:       If no, SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates.
    boolean          • no           You may omit this option by setting the environment variable F5_VALIDATE_CERTS.
                     • yes ←
   state             Choices:
   string            • present ←    When present, ensures that the iApp service is created and running. When absent, ensures that the iApp service has been removed.
                     • absent
                                    Indicates whether the application service is tied to the template, so when the template is updated, the application service changes to reflect the updates.
   strict_updates    Choices:       When yes, disallows any updates to the resources that the iApp service has created, if they are not updated directly through the iApp.
   boolean           • no           When no, allows updates outside of the iApp.
   added in 2.5      • yes ←        If this option is specified in the Ansible task, it will take precedence over any similar setting in the iApp Service payload that you provide in the parameters
                                    field.
   template                         The iApp template from which to instantiate a new service. This template must exist on your BIG-IP before you can successfully create a service.
   string                           When creating a new service, this parameter is required.
   traffic_group                    The traffic group for the iApp service. When creating a new service, if this value is not specified, the default of /Common/traffic-group-1 will be used.
   string                           If this option is specified in the Ansible task, it will take precedence over any similar setting in the iApp Service payload that you provide in the parameters
   added in 2.5                     field.

NOTES                   *bigip_iapp_service-notes*

   Note

     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
