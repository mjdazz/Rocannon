   Parameter Choices/Defaults                                                                                Comments
   count                      Number of packets to send. Default is 1.
   integer
   dest
   string /                   ip-addr | host-name | vrf vrf-name | ipv6 [ ipv6-addr | host-name | vrf vrf-name] (resolvable by switch) of the remote node.
   required
   size                       Specifies the size of the ICMP data portion of the packet, in bytes. This is the payload and does not include the header. The value can range from 0 to 10000. The
   integer                    default is 16..
   source                     IP address to be used as the origin of the ping packets.
   string
   state       Choices:
   string      • absent       Determines if the expected result is success or fail.
               • present ←
   timeout                    Specifies the time, in milliseconds for which the device waits for a reply from the pinged device. The value can range from 1 to 4294967296. The default is 5000 (5
   integer                    seconds).
   ttl                        Specifies the time to live as a maximum number of hops. The value can range from 1 to 255. The default is 64.
   integer
   vrf                        Specifies the Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) instance of the device to be pinged.
