SYNOPSIS                   *bigip_user*

     • Manage user accounts and user attributes on a BIG-IP. Typically this module operates only on the REST API users and not the CLI users. When specifying root, you may only change the password.
       Your other parameters will be ignored in this case. Changing the root password is not an idempotent operation. Therefore, it will change it every time this module attempts to change it.

NOTES                   *bigip_user-notes*

   Note

     • Requires BIG-IP versions >= 12.0.0
     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
