RETURN VALUES                   *gcp_compute_firewall_info-return values*

   Common return values are documented here, the following are the fields unique to this module:

             Key           Returned                                                                            Description
   resources               always   List of resources
   complex
     allowed               success  The list of ALLOW rules specified by this firewall. Each rule specifies a protocol and port-range tuple that describes a permitted connection.
     complex
           ip_protocol     success  The IP protocol to which this rule applies. The protocol type is required when creating a firewall rule. This value can either be one of the following well known
           string                   protocol strings (tcp, udp, icmp, esp, ah, sctp), or the IP protocol number.
           ports                    An optional list of ports to which this rule applies. This field is only applicable for UDP or TCP protocol. Each entry must be either an integer or a range. If
           list            success  not specified, this rule applies to connections through any port.
                                    Example inputs include: ["22"], ["80","443"], and ["12345-12349"].
     creationTimestamp     success  Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
     string
     denied                success  The list of DENY rules specified by this firewall. Each rule specifies a protocol and port-range tuple that describes a denied connection.
     complex
           ip_protocol     success  The IP protocol to which this rule applies. The protocol type is required when creating a firewall rule. This value can either be one of the following well known
           string                   protocol strings (tcp, udp, icmp, esp, ah, sctp), or the IP protocol number.
           ports                    An optional list of ports to which this rule applies. This field is only applicable for UDP or TCP protocol. Each entry must be either an integer or a range. If
           list            success  not specified, this rule applies to connections through any port.
                                    Example inputs include: ["22"], ["80","443"], and ["12345-12349"].
     description           success  An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.
     string
     destinationRanges     success  If destination ranges are specified, the firewall will apply only to traffic that has destination IP address in these ranges. These ranges must be expressed in
     list                           CIDR format. Only IPv4 is supported.
     direction             success  Direction of traffic to which this firewall applies; default is INGRESS. Note: For INGRESS traffic, it is NOT supported to specify destinationRanges; For EGRESS
     string                         traffic, it is NOT supported to specify sourceRanges OR sourceTags.
     disabled              success  Denotes whether the firewall rule is disabled, i.e not applied to the network it is associated with. When set to true, the firewall rule is not enforced and the
     boolean                        network behaves as if it did not exist. If this is unspecified, the firewall rule will be enabled.
     id                    success  The unique identifier for the resource.
     integer
     name                           Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name
     string                success  must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]"[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all
                                    following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
     network                        URL of the network resource for this firewall rule. If not specified when creating a firewall rule, the default network is used: global/networks/default If you
     dictionary            success  choose to specify this property, you can specify the network as a full or partial URL. For example, the following are all valid URLs:
                                    https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/global/ networks/my-network projects/myproject/global/networks/my-network global/networks/default .
     priority                       Priority for this rule. This is an integer between 0 and 65535, both inclusive. When not specified, the value assumed is 1000. Relative priorities determine
     integer               success  precedence of conflicting rules. Lower value of priority implies higher precedence (eg, a rule with priority 0 has higher precedence than a rule with priority
                                    1). DENY rules take precedence over ALLOW rules having equal priority.
                                    If source ranges are specified, the firewall will apply only to traffic that has source IP address in these ranges. These ranges must be expressed in CIDR
     sourceRanges          success  format. One or both of sourceRanges and sourceTags may be set. If both properties are set, the firewall will apply to traffic that has source IP address within
     list                           sourceRanges OR the source IP that belongs to a tag listed in the sourceTags property. The connection does not need to match both properties for the firewall to
                                    apply. Only IPv4 is supported.
                                    If source service accounts are specified, the firewall will apply only to traffic originating from an instance with a service account in this list. Source
     sourceServiceAccounts          service accounts cannot be used to control traffic to an instance's external IP address because service accounts are associated with an instance, not an IP
     list                  success  address. sourceRanges can be set at the same time as sourceServiceAccounts. If both are set, the firewall will apply to traffic that has source IP address within
                                    sourceRanges OR the source IP belongs to an instance with service account listed in sourceServiceAccount. The connection does not need to match both properties
                                    for the firewall to apply. sourceServiceAccounts cannot be used at the same time as sourceTags or targetTags.
                                    If source tags are specified, the firewall will apply only to traffic with source IP that belongs to a tag listed in source tags. Source tags cannot be used to
     sourceTags            success  control traffic to an instance's external IP address. Because tags are associated with an instance, not an IP address. One or both of sourceRanges and sourceTags
     list                           may be set. If both properties are set, the firewall will apply to traffic that has source IP address within sourceRanges OR the source IP that belongs to a tag
                                    listed in the sourceTags property. The connection does not need to match both properties for the firewall to apply.
     targetServiceAccounts          A list of service accounts indicating sets of instances located in the network that may make network connections as specified in allowed[].
     list                  success  targetServiceAccounts cannot be used at the same time as targetTags or sourceTags. If neither targetServiceAccounts nor targetTags are specified, the firewall
                                    rule applies to all instances on the specified network.
     targetTags            success  A list of instance tags indicating sets of instances located in the network that may make network connections as specified in allowed[].
     list                           If no targetTags are specified, the firewall rule applies to all instances on the specified network.
