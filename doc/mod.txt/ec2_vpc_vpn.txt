   filters                                       list of items to filter by, only one item needs to match to find the VPN that correlates. e.g. if the filter 'cidr' is ['194.168.2.0/24',
   -                                             '192.168.2.0/24'] and the VPN route only has the destination cidr block of '192.168.2.0/24' it will be found with this filter (assuming there are
                                                 not multiple VPNs that are matched). Another example, if the filter 'vpn' is equal to ['vpn-ccf7e7ad', 'vpn-cb0ae2a2'] and one of of the VPNs has
                                                 the state deleted (exists but is unmodifiable) and the other exists and is not deleted, it will be found via this filter. See examples.

NOTES                   *ec2_vpc_vpn-notes*

   Note

     • If parameters are not set within the module, the following environment variables can be used in decreasing order of precedence AWS_URL or EC2_URL, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID or AWS_ACCESS_KEY or
       EC2_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY or AWS_SECRET_KEY or EC2_SECRET_KEY, AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN or EC2_SECURITY_TOKEN, AWS_REGION or EC2_REGION
     • Ansible uses the boto configuration file (typically ~/.boto) if no credentials are provided. See https://boto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/boto_config_tut.html
     • AWS_REGION or EC2_REGION can be typically be used to specify the AWS region, when required, but this can also be configured in the boto config file
