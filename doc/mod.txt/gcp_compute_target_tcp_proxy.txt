   service                                     This field represents a link to a BackendService resource in GCP. It can be specified in two ways. First, you can place a dictionary with key
   dictionary / required                       'selfLink' and value of your resource's selfLink Alternatively, you can add `register: name-of-resource` to a gcp_compute_backend_service task and
                                               then set this service field to "{{ name-of-resource }}"
   service_account_contents                    The contents of a Service Account JSON file, either in a dictionary or as a JSON string that represents it.
   jsonarg
