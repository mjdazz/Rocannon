    Parameter   Choices/Defaults                                                                               Comments
   aggregate                     List of Layer-3 interfaces definitions. Each of the entry in aggregate list should define name of interface name and a optional ipv4 or ipv6 address.
   -
   ipv4                          IPv4 address to be set for the Layer-3 interface mentioned in name option. The address format is <ipv4 address>/<mask>, the mask is number in range 0-32 eg.
   -                             10.241.107.1/24
   ipv6                          IPv6 address to be set for the Layer-3 interface mentioned in name option. The address format is <ipv6 address>/<mask>, the mask is number in range 0-128 eg.
   -                             fd5d:12c9:2201:1::1/64
   name                          Name of the Layer-3 interface to be configured eg. Ethernet1/2

                                 A dict object containing connection details.
    auth_pass                    Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device. If authorize is false, then this argument does nothing. If the value is not
    -                            specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS will be used instead.
    authorize     Choices:       Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands. If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all commands in
    boolean       • no ←         non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE will be used instead.
                  • yes
    host                         Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport. The value of host is used as the destination address for
    - /                          the transport.
    required
    password                     Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not specified
    -                            in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD will be used instead.
    port        Default:         Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device.
    -           22
    ssh_keyfile                  Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is the path to the key used to authenticate the SSH session. If the
    -                            value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILEwill be used instead.
    timeout     Default:         Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before the
    -           10               operation is completed, the module will error.
    username                     Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not
    -                            specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will be used instead.
   state          Choices:
   -              • present ←    State of the Layer-3 interface configuration. It indicates if the configuration should be present or absent on remote device.
                  • absent
