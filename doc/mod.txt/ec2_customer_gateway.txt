NOTES                   *ec2_customer_gateway-notes*

   Note

     • You cannot create more than one customer gateway with the same IP address. If you run an identical request more than one time, the first request creates the customer gateway, and subsequent
       requests return information about the existing customer gateway. The subsequent requests do not create new customer gateway resources.
     • Return values contain customer_gateway and customer_gateways keys which are identical dicts. You should use customer_gateway. See
       https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras/issues/2773 for details.
     • If parameters are not set within the module, the following environment variables can be used in decreasing order of precedence AWS_URL or EC2_URL, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID or AWS_ACCESS_KEY or
       EC2_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY or AWS_SECRET_KEY or EC2_SECRET_KEY, AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN or EC2_SECURITY_TOKEN, AWS_REGION or EC2_REGION
     • Ansible uses the boto configuration file (typically ~/.boto) if no credentials are provided. See https://boto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/boto_config_tut.html
     • AWS_REGION or EC2_REGION can be typically be used to specify the AWS region, when required, but this can also be configured in the boto config file
