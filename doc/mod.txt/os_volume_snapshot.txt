PARAMETERS                   *os_volume_snapshot-parameters*

        Parameter      Choices/Defaults                                                                           Comments
   api_timeout                          How long should the socket layer wait before timing out for API calls. If this is omitted, nothing will be passed to the requests library.
   integer
                                        Dictionary containing auth information as needed by the cloud's auth plugin strategy. For the default password plugin, this would contain auth_url, username,
   auth                                 password, project_name and any information about domains (for example, os_user_domain_name or os_project_domain_name) if the cloud supports them. For other
   dictionary                           plugins, this param will need to contain whatever parameters that auth plugin requires. This parameter is not needed if a named cloud is provided or
                                        OpenStack OS_" environment variables are present.
   auth_type                            Name of the auth plugin to use. If the cloud uses something other than password authentication, the name of the plugin should be indicated here and the
   string                               contents of the auth parameter should be updated accordingly.
   availability_zone                    Availability zone in which to create the snapshot.
   -
   ca_cert                              A path to a CA Cert bundle that can be used as part of verifying SSL API requests.
   string                               aliases: cacert
   client_cert                          A path to a client certificate to use as part of the SSL transaction.
   string                               aliases: cert
   client_key                           A path to a client key to use as part of the SSL transaction.
   string                               aliases: key
   cloud                                Named cloud or cloud config to operate against. If cloud is a string, it references a named cloud config as defined in an OpenStack clouds.yaml file.
   raw                                  Provides default values for auth and auth_type. This parameter is not needed if auth is provided or if OpenStack OS_" environment variables are present. If
                                        cloud is a dict, it contains a complete cloud configuration like would be in a section of clouds.yaml.
   display_description                  String describing the snapshot
   -                                    aliases: description
   display_name                         Name of the snapshot
   - / required                         aliases: name
   force                 Choices:
   boolean               • no ←         Allows or disallows snapshot of a volume to be created when the volume is attached to an instance.

NOTES                   *os_volume_snapshot-notes*

   Note

     • The standard OpenStack environment variables, such as OS_USERNAME may be used instead of providing explicit values.
     • Auth information is driven by openstacksdk, which means that values can come from a yaml config file in /etc/ansible/openstack.yaml, /etc/openstack/clouds.yaml or
       ~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml, then from standard environment variables, then finally by explicit parameters in plays. More information can be found at
       https://docs.openstack.org/openstacksdk/
