SYNOPSIS                   *win_stat*

     • Returns information about a Windows file.
     • For non-Windows targets, use the stat module instead.

PARAMETERS                   *win_stat-parameters*

       Parameter      Choices/Defaults                                                                            Comments
                        Choices:
                        • md5
   checksum_algorithm   • sha1 ←       Algorithm to determine checksum of file.
   string               • sha256       Will throw an error if the host is unable to use specified algorithm.
                        • sha384
                        • sha512
   follow               Choices:       Whether to follow symlinks or junction points.
   boolean              • no ←         In the case of path pointing to another link, then that will be followed until no more links are found.
   added in 2.8         • yes
   get_checksum         Choices:
   boolean              • no           Whether to return a checksum of the file (default sha1)
                        • yes ←
                        Choices:       Whether to return the checksum sum of the file. Between Ansible 1.9 and Ansible 2.2 this is no longer an MD5, but a SHA1 instead. As of Ansible 2.3 this is
   get_md5              • no ←         back to an MD5. Will return None if host is unable to use specified algorithm.
   boolean              • yes          The default of this option changed from yes to no in Ansible 2.5 and will be removed altogether in Ansible 2.9.
                                       Use get_checksum=yes with checksum_algorithm=md5 to return an md5 hash under the checksum return value.
   path                                The full path of the file/object to get the facts of; both forward and back slashes are accepted.
   path / required                     aliases: dest, name
