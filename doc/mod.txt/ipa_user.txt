                                           IP or hostname of IPA server.
                                           If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable IPA_HOST will be used instead.
   ipa_host              Default:          If both the environment variable IPA_HOST and the value are not specified in the task, then DNS will be used to try to discover the FreeIPA server.
   string                "ipa.example.com" The relevant entry needed in FreeIPA is the 'ipa-ca' entry.
                                           If neither the DNS entry, nor the environment IPA_HOST, nor the value are available in the task, then the default value will be used.
                                           Environment variable fallback mechanism is added in Ansible 2.5.

                                           If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable IPA_PASS will be used instead.
   ipa_pass                                Note that if the 'urllib_gssapi' library is available, it is possible to use GSSAPI to authenticate to FreeIPA.
   string / required                       If the environment variable KRB5CCNAME is available, the module will use this kerberos credentials cache to authenticate to the FreeIPA server.
                                           If the environment variable KRB5_CLIENT_KTNAME is available, and KRB5CCNAME is not; the module will use this kerberos keytab to authenticate.
                                           If GSSAPI is not available, the usage of 'ipa_pass' is required.

                                           Port of FreeIPA / IPA server.
   ipa_port              Default:          If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable IPA_PORT will be used instead.
   integer               443               If both the environment variable IPA_PORT and the value are not specified in the task, then default value is set.

                           Choices:        Protocol used by IPA server.
   ipa_prot                • http          If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable IPA_PROT will be used instead.
   string                  • https ←       If both the environment variable IPA_PROT and the value are not specified in the task, then default value is set.
                                           Environment variable fallback mechanism is added in Ansible 2.5.
   ipa_timeout                             Specifies idle timeout (in seconds) for the connection.
   integer               Default:          For bulk operations, you may want to increase this in order to avoid timeout from IPA server.
   added in 2.7          10                If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable IPA_TIMEOUT will be used instead.
                                           If both the environment variable IPA_TIMEOUT and the value are not specified in the task, then default value is set.
