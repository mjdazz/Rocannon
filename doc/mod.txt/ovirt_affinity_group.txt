NOTES                   *ovirt_affinity_group-notes*

   Note

     • In order to use this module you have to install oVirt Python SDK. To ensure it’s installed with correct version you can create the following task: pip: name=ovirt-engine-sdk-python
       version=4.3.0

 # Examples don't contain auth parameter for simplicity,
 # look at ovirt_auth module to see how to reuse authentication:

 - name: Create(if not exists) and assign affinity group to VMs vm1 and vm2 and host host1
   ovirt_affinity_group:
     name: mygroup
     cluster: mycluster
     vm_enforcing: true
     vm_rule: positive
     host_enforcing: true
     host_rule: positive
     vms:
       - vm1
       - vm2
     hosts:
       - host1

 - name: Detach VMs from affinity group and disable VM rule
   ovirt_affinity_group:
     name: mygroup
     cluster: mycluster
     vm_enforcing: false
     vm_rule: disabled
     host_enforcing: true
     host_rule: positive
     vms: []
     hosts:
       - host1
       - host2

 - name: Remove affinity group
   ovirt_affinity_group:
     state: absent
     cluster: mycluster
     name: mygroup
