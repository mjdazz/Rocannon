SYNOPSIS                   *aireos_command*

     • Sends arbitrary commands to an aireos node and returns the results read from the device. This module includes an argument that will cause the module to wait for a specific condition before
       returning or timing out if the condition is not met.
     • Commands run in configuration mode with this module are not idempotent. Please use aireos_config to configure WLC devices.

Parameters¶

    Parameter   Choices/Defaults                                                                               Comments
   commands                      List of commands to send to the remote aireos device over the configured provider. The resulting output from the command is returned. If the wait_for argument is
   - / required                  provided, the module is not returned until the condition is satisfied or the number of retries has expired.
   interval     Default:         Configures the interval in seconds to wait between retries of the command. If the command does not pass the specified conditions, the interval indicates how long to
   -            1                wait before trying the command again.
   match          Choices:       The match argument is used in conjunction with the wait_for argument to specify the match policy. Valid values are all or any. If the value is set to all then all
   -              • any          conditionals in the wait_for must be satisfied. If the value is set to any then only one of the values must be satisfied.
                  • all ←
   provider                      A dict object containing connection details.
   -
    host                         Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport.
    string /                     The value of host is used as the destination address for the transport.
    required
    password                     Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.
    string                       This value is used to authenticate the SSH session.
                                 If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD will be used instead.
    port        Default:         Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device.
    integer     22
    ssh_keyfile                  Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.
    path                         This value is the path to the key used to authenticate the SSH session.
                                 If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE will be used instead.
    timeout     Default:         Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands.
    integer     10               If the timeout is exceeded before the operation is completed, the module will error.
    username                     Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.
    string                       This value is used to authenticate the SSH session.
                                 If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will be used instead.
   retries      Default:         Specifies the number of retries a command should by tried before it is considered failed. The command is run on the target device every retry and evaluated against
   -            10               the wait_for conditions.
   wait_for                      List of conditions to evaluate against the output of the command. The task will wait for each condition to be true before moving forward. If the conditional is not
   -                             true within the configured number of retries, the task fails. See examples.
