SYNOPSIS                   *panos_query_rules-synopsis*

     • 
          • Security policies allow you to enforce rules and take action, and can be as general or specific as needed. The policy rules are compared against the incoming traffic in sequence, and
            because the first rule that matches the traffic is applied, the more specific rules must precede the more general ones.
