PARAMETERS                   *bigip_profile_oneconnect-parameters*

         Parameter       Choices/Defaults                                                                          Comments
   description                            Description of the profile.
   string
                                          Specifies the number of seconds that a connection is idle before the connection flow is eligible for deletion.
   idle_timeout_override                  When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent profile.
   string                                 You may specify a number of seconds for the timeout override.
                                          When disabled, specifies that there is no timeout override for the connection.
                                          When indefinite, Specifies that a connection may be idle with no timeout override.
                                          When none, simultaneous in-flight requests and responses over TCP connections to a pool member are counted toward the limit. This is the historical
                                          behavior.
                           Choices:       When idle, idle connections will be dropped as the TCP connection limit is reached. For short intervals, during the overlap of the idle connection being
   limit_type              • none         dropped and the new connection being established, the TCP connection limit may be exceeded.
   string                  • idle         When strict, the TCP connection limit is honored with no exceptions. This means that idle connections will prevent new TCP connections from being made
                           • strict       until they expire, even if they could otherwise be reused.
                                          strict is not a recommended configuration except in very special cases with short expiration timeouts.
                                          When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent profile.
   maximum_age                            Specifies the maximum number of seconds allowed for a connection in the connection reuse pool.
   integer                                For any connection with an age higher than this value, the system removes that connection from the re-use pool.
                                          When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent profile.
   maximum_reuse                          Specifies the maximum number of times that a server-side connection can be reused.
   integer                                When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent profile.
   maximum_size                           Specifies the maximum number of connections that the system holds in the connection reuse pool.
   integer                                If the pool is already full, then a server-side connection closes after the response is completed.
                                          When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent profile.
   name                                   Specifies the name of the OneConnect profile.
   string / required
   parent                                 Specifies the profile from which this profile inherits settings.
   string                                 When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is the system-supplied oneconnect profile.
   partition             Default:         Device partition to manage resources on.
   string                "Common"

      timeout                             Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before the
      integer                             operation is completed, the module will error.
      transport            Choices:
      string               • cli          Configures the transport connection to use when connecting to the remote device.
                           • rest ←

   share_pools             Choices:       Indicates that connections may be shared not only within a virtual server, but also among similar virtual servers
   boolean                 • no           When yes, all virtual servers that use the same OneConnect and other internal network profiles can share connections.
                           • yes          When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent profile.
                                          Specifies a value that the system applies to the source address to determine its eligibility for reuse.

   source_mask                            The system applies the value of this setting to the server-side source address to determine its eligibility for reuse.
   string                                 A mask of 0 causes the system to share reused connections across all source addresses. A host mask of 32 causes the system to share only those reused
                                          connections originating from the same source address.
                                          When you are using a SNAT or SNAT pool, the server-side source address is translated first and then the OneConnect mask is applied to the translated
                                          address.
   state                   Choices:       When present, ensures that the profile exists.
   string                  • present ←    When absent, ensures the profile is removed.
                           • absent

   Note

     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
