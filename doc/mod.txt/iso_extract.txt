SYNOPSIS                   *iso_extract*

     • This module has two possible ways of operation.
     • If 7zip is installed on the system, this module extracts files from an ISO into a temporary directory and copies files to a given destination, if needed.
     • If the user has mount-capabilities (CAP_SYS_ADMIN on Linux) this module mounts the ISO image to a temporary location, and copies files to a given destination, if needed.

REQUIREMENTS                   *iso_extract-requirements*

   The below requirements are needed on the host that executes this module.

     • Either 7z (from 7zip or p7zip package)
     • Or mount capabilities (root-access, or CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability on Linux)

PARAMETERS                   *iso_extract-parameters*

      Parameter    Choices/Defaults                                                                             Comments
   dest                             The destination directory to extract files to.
   path / required
   executable      Default:
   path            "7z"             The path to the 7z executable to use for extracting files from the ISO.
   added in 2.4
   files                            A list of files to extract from the image.
   list / required                  Extracting directories does not work.
   force             Choices:       If yes, which will replace the remote file when contents are different than the source.
   boolean           • no           If no, the file will only be extracted and copied if the destination does not already exist.
   added in 2.4      • yes ←        Alias thirsty has been deprecated and will be removed in 2.13.
                                    aliases: thirsty
   image                            The ISO image to extract files from.
   path / required                  aliases: path, src

NOTES                   *iso_extract-notes*

   Note

     • Only the file checksum (content) is taken into account when extracting files from the ISO image. If force=no, only checks the presence of the file.
     • In Ansible 2.3 this module was using mount and umount commands only, requiring root access. This is no longer needed with the introduction of 7zip for extraction.
