PARAMETERS                   *bigip_appsvcs_extension-parameters*

      Parameter    Choices/Defaults                                                                             Comments
                                    Declaration of tenants configured on the system.
                                    This parameter is most often used along with the file or template lookup plugins. Refer to the examples section for correct usage.
                                    For anything advanced or with formatting consider using the template lookup.
   content                          This can additionally be used for specifying application service configurations directly in YAML, however that is not an encouraged practice and, if used at all,
   raw / required                   should only be used for the absolute smallest of configurations to prevent your Playbooks from becoming too large.
                                    If you content includes encrypted values (such as ciphertexts, passphrases, etc), the returned changed value will always be true.
                                    If you are using the to_nice_json filter, it will cause this module to fail because the purpose of that filter is to format the JSON to be human-readable and
                                    this process includes inserting "extra characters that break JSON validators.
   force             Choices:       Force updates a declaration.
   boolean           • no ←         This parameter should be used in cases where your declaration includes items that are encrypted or in cases (such as WAF Policies) where you want a large reload
                     • yes          to take place.

NOTES                   *bigip_appsvcs_extension-notes*

   Note

     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
