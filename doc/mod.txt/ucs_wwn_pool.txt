       Parameter     Choices/Defaults                                                                            Comments
                                      A description of the WWNN or WWPN pool.
   description                        Enter up to 256 characters.
   -                                  You can use any characters or spaces except the following:
                                      ` (accent mark), (backslash), ^ (carat), " (double quote), = (equal sign), > (greater than), < (less than), or ' (single quote).
                                      aliases: descr
   first_addr                         The first initiator in the World Wide Name (WWN) block.
   -                                  This is the From field in the UCS Manager Add WWN Blocks menu.
   hostname                           IP address or hostname of Cisco UCS Manager.
   string / required
                                      The last initiator in the World Wide Name (WWN) block.
   last_addr                          This is the To field in the UCS Manager Add WWN Blocks menu.
   -                                  For WWxN pools, the pool size must be a multiple of ports-per-node + 1.
                                      For example, if there are 7 ports per node, the pool size must be a multiple of 8.
                                      If there are 63 ports per node, the pool size must be a multiple of 64.
                                      The name of the World Wide Node Name (WWNN) or World Wide Port Name (WWPN) pool.
   name                               This name can be between 1 and 32 alphanumeric characters.
   - / required                       You cannot use spaces or any special characters other than - (hyphen), "_" (underscore), : (colon), and . (period).
                                      You cannot change this name after the WWNN or WWPN pool is created.
                       Choices:       The Assignment Order field.
   order               • default ←    This can be one of the following:
   -                   • sequential   default - Cisco UCS Manager selects a random identity from the pool.
                                      sequential - Cisco UCS Manager selects the lowest available identity from the pool.
   org_dn            Default:         Org dn (distinguished name)
   -                 "org-root"

   state               Choices:       If present, will verify WWNNs/WWPNs are present and will create if needed.
   -                   • present ←    If absent, will verify WWNNs/WWPNs are absent and will delete if needed.
                       • absent
   use_proxy           Choices:
   boolean             • no           If no, will not use the proxy as defined by system environment variable.
