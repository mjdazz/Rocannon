SYNOPSIS                   *cnos_image*

     • This module allows you to work with switch firmware images. It provides a way to download a firmware image to a network device from a remote server using FTP, SFTP, TFTP, or SCP. The first
       step is to create a directory from where the remote server can be reached. The next step is to provide the full file path of the image’s location. Authentication details required by the
       remote server must be provided as well. By default, this method makes the newly downloaded firmware image the active image, which will be used by the switch during the next restart. This
       module uses SSH to manage network device configuration. The results of the operation will be placed in a directory named ‘results’ that must be created by the user in their local directory
       to where the playbook is run.

   deviceType       • g8332_cnos
   string /         • NE0152T      This specifies the type of device where the method is executed. The choices NE1072T,NE1032,NE1032T,NE10032,NE2572 are added since Ansible 2.4. The choice NE0152T
   required         • NE1072T      is added since 2.8
                    • NE1032
                    • NE1032T
                    • NE10032
                    • NE2572
   enablePassword                  Configures the password used to enter Global Configuration command mode on the switch. If the switch does not request this password, the parameter is
   string                          ignored.While generally the value should come from the inventory file, you can also specify it as a variable. This parameter is optional. If it is not specified,
                                   no default value will be used.
   host                            This is the variable used to search the hosts file at /etc/ansible/hosts and identify the IP address of the device on which the template is going to be applied.
   string /                        Usually the Ansible keyword {{ inventory_hostname }} is specified in the playbook as an abstraction of the group of network elements that need to be configured.
   required
   imgpath                         This specifies the full file path of the image located on the remote server. In case the relative path is used as the variable value, the root folder for the user
   - / required                    of the server needs to be specified.
                    Choices:
   imgtype          • all
   - / required     • boot         This specifies the firmware image type to be downloaded
                    • os
                    • onie
   outputfile                      This specifies the file path where the output of each command execution is saved. Each command that is specified in the merged template file and each response
   string /                        from the device are saved here. Usually the location is the results folder, but you can choose another location based on your write permission.
   required
   password                        Configures the password used to authenticate the connection to the remote device. The value of the password parameter is used to authenticate the SSH session.
   string /                        While generally the value should come from the inventory file, you can also specify it as a variable. This parameter is optional. If it is not specified, no
   required                        default value will be used.
                    Choices:
   protocol         • SFTP         This refers to the protocol used by the network device to interact with the remote server from where to download the firmware image. The choices are FTP, SFTP,
   - / required     • SCP          TFTP, or SCP. Any other protocols will result in error. If this parameter is not specified there is no default value to be used.
                    • FTP
                    • TFTP
   serverip                        This specifies the IP Address of the remote server from where the software image will be downloaded.
   - / required
   serverpassword                  Specify the password for the server relating to the protocol used
   -
   serverusername                  Specify the username for the server relating to the protocol used
   - / required
   username                        Configures the username used to authenticate the connection to the remote device. The value of the username parameter is used to authenticate the SSH session.
   string /                        While generally the value should come from the inventory file, you can also specify it as a variable. This parameter is optional. If it is not specified, no
