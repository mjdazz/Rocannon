   affinity
   dictionary                              Describes node affinity scheduling rules for the vm.

                                           If the affinity requirements specified by this field are not met at scheduling time, the vm will not be scheduled onto the node. If the affinity
         hard                              requirements specified by this field cease to be met at some point during vm execution (e.g. due to a vm label update), the system may or may not try to
         dictionary                        eventually evict the vm from its node. When there are multiple elements, the lists of nodes corresponding to each term are intersected, i.e. all terms
                                           must be satisfied.
                                           The scheduler will prefer to schedule vms to nodes that satisfy the affinity expressions specified by this field, but it may choose a node that violates
         soft                              one or more of the expressions. The node that is most preferred is the one with the greatest sum of weights, i.e. for each node that meets all of the
         dictionary                        scheduling requirements (resource request, requiredDuringScheduling affinity expressions, etc.), compute a sum by iterating through the elements of this
                                           field and adding weight to the sum if the node has vms which matches the corresponding term; the nodes with the highest sum are the most preferred.
   anti_affinity
   dictionary                              Describes vm anti-affinity scheduling rules e.g. avoid putting this vm in the same node, zone, etc. as some other vms.

                                           Labels are key/value pairs that are attached to virtual machines. Labels are intended to be used to specify identifying attributes of virtual machines
   labels                                  that are meaningful and relevant to users, but do not directly imply semantics to the core system. Labels can be used to organize and to select subsets of
   dictionary                              virtual machines. Labels can be attached to virtual machines at creation time and subsequently added and modified at any time.

         hard                              If the affinity requirements specified by this field are not met at scheduling time, the vm will not be scheduled onto the node. If the affinity
         dictionary                        requirements specified by this field cease to be met at some point during vm execution (e.g. due to an update), the system may or may not try to

                                           The scheduler will prefer to schedule vms to nodes that satisfy the affinity expressions specified by this field, but it may choose a node that violates
         soft                              one or more of the expressions. The node that is most preferred is the one with the greatest sum of weights, i.e. for each node that meets all of the
         dictionary                        scheduling requirements (resource request, requiredDuringScheduling affinity expressions, etc.), compute a sum by iterating through the elements of this
                                           field and adding weight to the sum if the node matches the corresponding match_expressions; the nodes with the highest sum are the most preferred.

NOTES                   *kubevirt_rs-notes*

   Note

     • The OpenShift Python client wraps the K8s Python client, providing full access to all of the APIS and models available on both platforms. For API version details and additional information
       visit https://github.com/openshift/openshift-restclient-python
     • To avoid SSL certificate validation errors when validate_certs is True, the full certificate chain for the API server must be provided via ca_cert or in the kubeconfig file.
     • In order to use this module you have to install Openshift Python SDK. To ensure it’s installed with correct version you can create the following task: pip: name=openshift>=0.8.2
