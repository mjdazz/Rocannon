   api_user                                        The OCID of the user, on whose behalf, OCI APIs are invoked. If not set, then the value of the OCI_USER_OCID environment variable, if any, is
   string                                          used. This option is required if the user is not specified through a configuration file (See config_file_location). To get the user's OCID, please
                                                   refer https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm.

   string                                          option is required if the private key is not specified through a configuration file (See config_file_location). If the key is encrypted with a
                                                   pass-phrase, the api_user_key_pass_phrase option must also be provided.
   api_user_key_pass_phrase                        Passphrase used by the key referenced in api_user_key_file, if it is encrypted. If not set, then the value of the OCI_USER_KEY_PASS_PHRASE
   string                                          variable, if any, is used. This option is required if the key passphrase is not specified through a configuration file (See config_file_location).

   auth_type                  • api_key ←          api_user_key_file) in your config file will be used. If this 'auth_type' module option is not specified, the value of the OCI_ANSIBLE_AUTH_TYPE,
   string                     • instance_principal if any, is used. Use auth_type="instance_principal" to use instance principal based authentication when running ansible playbooks within an OCI
                                                   compute instance.

   -
   compartment_id                                  The OCID of the compartment to contain the VCN. Required when creating a VCN with state=present. This option is mutually exclusive with vcn_id.
   string
   config_file_location                            Path to configuration file. If not set then the value of the OCI_CONFIG_FILE environment variable, if any, is used. Otherwise, defaults to
   string                                          ~/.oci/config.
   config_profile_name      Default:               The profile to load from the config file referenced by config_file_location. If not set, then the value of the OCI_CONFIG_PROFILE environment
   string                   "DEFAULT"              variable, if any, is used. Otherwise, defaults to the "DEFAULT" profile in config_file_location.

   string                                          VNIC within this subnet (for example, bminstance-1.subnet123.vcn1.oraclevcn.com). Not required to be unique, but it's a best practice to set
                                                   unique DNS labels for VCNs in your tenancy. Must be an alphanumeric string that begins with a letter. The value cannot be changed.

   list                                            attributes of a resource except freeform_tags are used to uniquely identify a resource.

   string                                          specified through a configuration file (See config_file_location). To get the tenancy OCID, please refer
