SYNOPSIS                   *ios_user*

     • This module provides declarative management of the local usernames configured on network devices. It allows playbooks to manage either individual usernames or the aggregate of usernames in
       the current running config. It also supports purging usernames from the configuration that are not explicitly defined.

PARAMETERS                   *ios_user-parameters*

        Parameter      Choices/Defaults                                                                           Comments
   aggregate                            The set of username objects to be configured on the remote Cisco IOS device. The list entries can either be the username or a hash of username and
   -                                    properties. This argument is mutually exclusive with the name argument.

                                        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using connection: network_cli and become: yes with become_pass.

                                        Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device. If authorize is false, then this argument does nothing. If the value

                                        Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands. If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all
                                        commands in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE will be used instead.
   configured_password                  The password to be configured on the Cisco IOS device. The password needs to be provided in clear and it will be encrypted on the device. Please note that

   nopassword            Choices:
   boolean               • no           Defines the username without assigning a password. This will allow the user to login to the system without being authenticated by a password.

   password_type         Choices:
   -                     • secret ←     This argument determines whether a 'password' or 'secret' will be configured.

       auth_pass                        Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device. If authorize is false, then this argument does nothing. If the value
       string                           is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS will be used instead.

       required
       password                         Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not

       integer         22
       ssh_keyfile                      Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is the path to the key used to authenticate the SSH session. If

       string                           specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will be used instead.
   purge                 Choices:       Instructs the module to consider the resource definition absolute. It will remove any previously configured usernames on the device with the exception of the
   boolean               • no ←         `admin` user (the current defined set of users).
                         • yes

   update_password       Choices:       Since passwords are encrypted in the device running config, this argument will instruct the module when to change the password. When set to always, the
   -                     • on_create    password will always be updated in the device and when set to on_create the password will be updated only if the username is created.
