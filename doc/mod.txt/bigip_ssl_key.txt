NOTES                   *bigip_ssl_key-notes*

   Note

     • This module does not behave like other modules that you might include in roles where referencing files or templates first looks in the role’s files or templates directory. To have it behave
       that way, use the Ansible file or template lookup (see Examples). The lookups behave as expected in a role context.
     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.

EXAMPLES                   *bigip_ssl_key-examples*

   bigip_ssl_key:
     name: key-name
     state: present
     content: "{{ lookup('file', '/path/to/key.key') }}"
     provider:
       server: lb.mydomain.com
       user: admin
       password: secret
   delegate_to: localhost

 - name: Delete key
   bigip_ssl_key:
     name: key-name
     state: absent
     provider:
       server: lb.mydomain.com
       user: admin
       password: secret
