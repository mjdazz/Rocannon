                                        A dict object containing connection details.
     auth_pass                          Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device. If authorize is false, then this argument does nothing. If the value
     string                             is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS will be used instead.
     added in 2.5.3
     authorize           Choices:       Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands. If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all
     boolean             • no ←         commands in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE will be used instead.
     added in 2.5.3      • yes
     host                               Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport. The value of host is used as the destination address
     string / required                  for the transport.
     password                           Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This is a common argument used for either cli or nxapi transports. If the
     string                             value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD will be used instead.
     port              Default:         Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device. This value applies to either cli or nxapi. The port value will default to the
     integer           "0 (use common   appropriate transport common port if none is provided in the task. (cli=22, http=80, https=443).
                       port)"
     ssh_keyfile                        Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This argument is only used for the cli transport. If the value is not
     string                             specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE will be used instead.
     timeout           Default:         Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before the
     integer           10               operation is completed, the module will error. NX-API can be slow to return on long-running commands (sh mac, sh bgp, etc).
     transport           Choices:       Configures the transport connection to use when connecting to the remote device. The transport argument supports connectivity to the device over cli (ssh) or
     string / required   • cli ←        nxapi.
                         • nxapi
     use_proxy           Choices:
     boolean             • no           If no, the environment variables http_proxy and https_proxy will be ignored.
     added in 2.5        • yes ←
     use_ssl             Choices:
     boolean             • no ←         Configures the transport to use SSL if set to yes only when the transport=nxapi, otherwise this value is ignored.
                         • yes
     username                           Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate either the CLI login or the nxapi
     string                             authentication depending on which transport is used. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will
                                        be used instead.
     validate_certs      Choices:       If no, SSL certificates will not be validated. This should only be used on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. If the transport
     boolean             • no           argument is not nxapi, this value is ignored.
                         • yes ←
                         Choices:
   state                 • present ←    Manage the state of the Layer-2 Interface configuration.
   -                     • absent
                         • unconfigured
   trunk_allowed_vlans                  List of allowed VLANs in a given trunk port. If mode=trunk, these are the only VLANs that will be configured on the trunk, i.e. "2-10,15".
   -
   trunk_vlans                          List of VLANs to be configured in trunk port. If mode=trunk, used as the VLAN range to ADD or REMOVE from the trunk.
   -                                    aliases: trunk_add_vlans
