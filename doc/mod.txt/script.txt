SYNOPSIS                   *script*

     • The script module takes the script name followed by a list of space-delimited arguments.
     • Either a free form command or cmd parameter is required, see the examples.
     • The local script at path will be transferred to the remote node and then executed.
     • The given script will be processed through the shell environment on the remote node.
     • This module does not require python on the remote system, much like the raw module.
     • This module is also supported for Windows targets.

NOTES                   *script-notes*

   Note

     • It is usually preferable to write Ansible modules rather than pushing scripts. Convert your script to an Ansible module for bonus points!
     • The ssh connection plugin will force pseudo-tty allocation via -tt when scripts are executed. Pseudo-ttys do not have a stderr channel and all stderr is sent to stdout. If you depend on
       separated stdout and stderr result keys, please switch to a copy+command set of tasks instead of using script.
     • If the path to the local script contains spaces, it needs to be quoted.
     • This module is also supported for Windows targets.
