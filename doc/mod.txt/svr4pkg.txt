SYNOPSIS                   *svr4pkg*

     • Manages SVR4 packages on Solaris 10 and 11.
     • These were the native packages on Solaris <= 10 and are available as a legacy feature in Solaris 11.
     • Note that this is a very basic packaging system. It will not enforce dependencies on install or remove.

PARAMETERS                   *svr4pkg-parameters*

     Parameter   Choices/Defaults                                                                              Comments
   category        Choices:
   boolean         • no           Install/Remove category instead of a single package.
                   • yes
   name                           Package name, e.g. SUNWcsr
   - / required
   proxy                          HTTP[s] proxy to be used if src is a URL.
   -
   response_file                  Specifies the location of a response file to be used if package expects input on install. (added in Ansible 1.4)
   -
   src                            Specifies the location to install the package from. Required when state=present.
   -                              Can be any path acceptable to the pkgadd command's -d option. e.g.: somefile.pkg, /dir/with/pkgs, http:/server/mypkgs.pkg.
                                  If using a file or directory, they must already be accessible by the host. See the copy module for a way to get them there.
   state           Choices:       Whether to install (present), or remove (absent) a package.
   - / required    • present      If the package is to be installed, then src is required.
                   • absent       The SVR4 package system doesn't provide an upgrade operation. You need to uninstall the old, then install the new package.
   zone            Choices:       Whether to install the package only in the current zone, or install it into all zones.
   -               • current      The installation into all zones works only if you are working with the global zone.
                   • all ←
