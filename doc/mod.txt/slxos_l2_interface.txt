     • This module provides declarative management of Layer-2 interface on Extreme slxos devices.

PARAMETERS                   *slxos_l2_interface-parameters*

        Parameter       Choices/Defaults                                                                           Comments
   access_vlan                            Configure given VLAN in access port. If mode=access, used as the access VLAN ID.
   -
   aggregate                              List of Layer-2 interface definitions.
   -
   mode                  Choices:
   -                     • access ←       Mode in which interface needs to be configured.
                         • trunk
   name                                   Full name of the interface excluding any logical unit number, i.e. Ethernet 0/1.
   - / required                           aliases: interface
   native_vlan                            Native VLAN to be configured in trunk port. If mode=trunk, used as the trunk native VLAN ID.
   -
                         Choices:
   state                 • present ←      Manage the state of the Layer-2 Interface configuration.
   -                     • absent
                         • unconfigured
   trunk_allowed_vlans                    List of allowed VLANs in a given trunk port. If mode=trunk, these are the only VLANs that will be configured on the trunk, i.e. "2-10,15".
   -
   trunk_vlans                            List of VLANs to be configured in trunk port. If mode=trunk, used as the VLAN range to ADD or REMOVE from the trunk.

EXAMPLES                   *slxos_l2_interface-examples*

 - name: Ensure Ethernet 0/5 is in its default l2 interface state
   slxos_l2_interface:
     name: Ethernet 0/5
     state: unconfigured

 - name: Ensure Ethernet 0/5 is configured for access vlan 20
   slxos_l2_interface:
     name: Ethernet 0/5
     mode: access
     access_vlan: 20

 - name: Ensure Ethernet 0/5 only has vlans 5-10 as trunk vlans
   slxos_l2_interface:
     name: Ethernet 0/5
     mode: trunk
     native_vlan: 10
     trunk_vlans: 5-10

 - name: Ensure Ethernet 0/5 is a trunk port and ensure 2-50 are being tagged (doesn't mean others aren't also being tagged)
   slxos_l2_interface:
     name: Ethernet 0/5
     mode: trunk
     native_vlan: 10
     trunk_vlans: 2-50

 - name: Ensure these VLANs are not being tagged on the trunk
   slxos_l2_interface:
     name: Ethernet 0/5
     mode: trunk
     trunk_vlans: 51-4094
     state: absent
