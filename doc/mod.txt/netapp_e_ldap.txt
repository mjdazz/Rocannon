   api_password
   string /                        The password to authenticate with the SANtricity Web Services Proxy or Embedded Web Services API.
   required
   api_url
   string /                        The url to the SANtricity Web Services Proxy or Embedded Web Services API. Example https://prod-1.wahoo.acme.com/devmgr/v2
   required
   api_username
   string /                        The username to authenticate with the SANtricity Web Services Proxy or Embedded Web Services API.
   required
   attributes     Default:         The user attributes that should be considered for the group to role mapping.
   -              "memberOf"       Typically this is used with something like 'memberOf', and a user's access is tested against group membership or lack thereof.
   identifier                      This is a unique identifier for the configuration (for cases where there are multiple domains configured).
   -                               If this is not specified, but state=present, we will utilize a default value of 'default'.
   log_path                        A local path to a file to be used for debug logging
   -
                                   The domain name[s] that will be utilized when authenticating to identify which domain to utilize.
   name                            Default to use the DNS name of the server.
   -                               The only requirement is that the name[s] be resolvable.
                                   Example: [email protected]
   password                        This is the password for the bind user account.
   - / required                    aliases: bind_password
                                   This is where you specify which groups should have access to what permissions for the storage-system.
                                   For example, all users in group A will be assigned all 4 available roles, which will allow access to all the management functionality of the system (super-user).
                                   Those in group B only have the storage.monitor role, which will allow only read-only access.
                                   This is specified as a mapping of regular expressions to a list of roles. See the examples.
   role_mappings                   The roles that will be assigned to to the group/groups matching the provided regex.
   - / required                    storage.admin allows users full read/write access to storage objects and operations.
                                   storage.monitor allows users read-only access to storage objects and operations.
                                   support.admin allows users access to hardware, diagnostic information, the Major Event Log, and other critical support-related functionality, but not the storage
                                   configuration.
                                   security.admin allows users access to authentication/authorization configuration, as well as the audit log configuration, and certification management.
   search_base                     The search base is used to find group memberships of the user.
   - / required                    Example: ou=users,dc=example,dc=com
   server                          This is the LDAP server url.
   - / required                    The connection string should be specified as using the ldap or ldaps protocol along with the port information.
                                   aliases: server_url
   ssid           Default:         The ID of the array to manage. This value must be unique for each array.
   string         1
   state            Choices:
   -                • present ←    Enable/disable LDAP support on the system. Disabling will clear out any existing defined domains.
                    • absent
   user_attribute Default:         This is the attribute we will use to match the provided username when a user attempts to authenticate.
   -              "sAMAccountName"
   username                        This is the user account that will be used for querying the LDAP server.
   - / required                    Example: CN=MyBindAcct,OU=ServiceAccounts,DC=example,DC=com
                                   aliases: bind_username
   validate_certs   Choices:
   boolean          • no           Should https certificates be validated?
                    • yes ←

NOTES                   *netapp_e_ldap-notes*

   Note

     • Check mode is supported.
     • This module allows you to define one or more LDAP domains identified uniquely by identifier to use for authentication. Authorization is determined by role_mappings, in that different groups
       of users may be given different (or no), access to certain aspects of the system and API.
     • The local user accounts will still be available if the LDAP server becomes unavailable/inaccessible.
     • Generally, you’ll need to get the details of your organization’s LDAP server before you’ll be able to configure the system for using LDAP authentication; every implementation is likely to be
       very different.
     • This API is currently only supported with the Embedded Web Services API v2.0 and higher, or the Web Services Proxy v3.0 and higher.
     • The E-Series Ansible modules require either an instance of the Web Services Proxy (WSP), to be available to manage the storage-system, or an E-Series storage-system that supports the
       Embedded Web Services API.
     • Embedded Web Services is currently available on the E2800, E5700, EF570, and newer hardware models.
     • netapp_e_storage_system may be utilized for configuring the systems managed by a WSP instance.
