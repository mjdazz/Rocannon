SYNOPSIS                   *openssl_privatekey_info*

     • This module allows one to query information on OpenSSL private keys.
     • In case the key consistency checks fail, the module will fail as this indicates a faked private key. In this case, all return variables are still returned. Note that key consistency checks
       are not available all key types; if none is available, none is returned for key_is_consistent.
     • It uses the pyOpenSSL or cryptography python library to interact with OpenSSL. If both the cryptography and PyOpenSSL libraries are available (and meet the minimum version requirements)
       cryptography will be preferred as a backend over PyOpenSSL (unless the backend is forced with select_crypto_backend). Please note that the PyOpenSSL backend was deprecated in Ansible 2.9 and
       will be removed in Ansible 2.13.

REQUIREMENTS                   *openssl_privatekey_info-requirements*

   The below requirements are needed on the host that executes this module.

     • PyOpenSSL >= 0.15 or cryptography >= 1.2.3

PARAMETERS                   *openssl_privatekey_info-parameters*

          Parameter        Choices/Defaults                                                                         Comments
   passphrase                               The passphrase for the private key.
   string
   path                                     Remote absolute path where the private key file is loaded from.
   path / required
   return_private_key_data   Choices:       Whether to return private key data.
   boolean                   • no ←         Only set this to yes when you want private information about this key to leave the remote machine.
                             • yes          WARNING: you have to make sure that private key data isn't accidentally logged!
                                            Determines which crypto backend to use.
                             Choices:       The default choice is auto, which tries to use cryptography if available, and falls back to pyopenssl.
   select_crypto_backend     • auto ←       If set to pyopenssl, will try to use the pyOpenSSL library.
   string                    • cryptography If set to cryptography, will try to use the cryptography library.
                             • pyopenssl    Please note that the pyopenssl backend has been deprecated in Ansible 2.9, and will be removed in Ansible 2.13. From that point on, only the cryptography
                                            backend will be available.

RETURN VALUES                   *openssl_privatekey_info-return values*

   Common return values are documented here, the following are the fields unique to this module:

   can_load_key            always                  Whether the module was able to load the private key from disk
   boolean
   can_parse_key           always                  Whether the module was able to parse the private key
   boolean
   key_is_consistent       always                  Whether the key is consistent. Can also return none next to yes and no, to indicate that consistency couldn't be checked.
   boolean                                         In case the check returns no, the module will fail.
