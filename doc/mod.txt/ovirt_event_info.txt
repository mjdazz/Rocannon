SYNOPSIS                   *ovirt_event_info*

     • Retrieve information about one or more oVirt/RHV events.
     • This module was called ovirt_event_facts before Ansible 2.9, returning ansible_facts. Note that the ovirt_event_info module no longer returns ansible_facts!

   Aliases: ovirt_event_facts

PARAMETERS                   *ovirt_event_info-parameters*

       Parameter     Choices/Defaults                                                                            Comments
                                      Dictionary with values needed to create HTTP/HTTPS connection to oVirt:
                                      username[required] - The name of the user, something like [email protected]. Default value is set by OVIRT_USERNAME environment variable.
                                      password[required] - The password of the user. Default value is set by OVIRT_PASSWORD environment variable.
                                      url- A string containing the API URL of the server, usually something like `https://server.example.com/ovirt-engine/api`. Default value is set by OVIRT_URL
                                      environment variable. Either url or hostname is required.
   auth                               hostname - A string containing the hostname of the server, usually something like `server.example.com`. Default value is set by OVIRT_HOSTNAME environment
   dictionary /                       variable. Either url or hostname is required.
   required                           token - Token to be used instead of login with username/password. Default value is set by OVIRT_TOKEN environment variable.
                                      insecure - A boolean flag that indicates if the server TLS certificate and host name should be checked.
                                      ca_file - A PEM file containing the trusted CA certificates. The certificate presented by the server will be verified using these CA certificates. If `ca_file`
                                      parameter is not set, system wide CA certificate store is used. Default value is set by OVIRT_CAFILE environment variable.
                                      kerberos - A boolean flag indicating if Kerberos authentication should be used instead of the default basic authentication.
                                      headers - Dictionary of HTTP headers to be added to each API call.
   case_sensitive      Choices:       Indicates if the search performed using the search parameter should be performed taking case into account. The default value is true, which means that case is
   boolean             • no           taken into account. If you want to search ignoring case set it to false.
                       • yes ←
   fetch_nested        Choices:       If yes the module will fetch additional data from the API.
   boolean             • no           It will fetch only IDs of nested entity. It doesn't fetch multiple levels of nested attributes. Only the attributes of the current entity. User can configure
                       • yes          to fetch other attributes of the nested entities by specifying nested_attributes.
   from_                              Indicates the event index after which events should be returned. The indexes of events are strictly increasing, so when this parameter is used only the events
   integer                            with greater indexes will be returned.
   headers                            Additional HTTP headers.
   string
   max                                Sets the maximum number of events to return. If not specified all the events are returned.
   integer
   nested_attributes                  Specifies list of the attributes which should be fetched from the API.
   list                               This parameter apply only when fetch_nested is true.
   query                              Additional URL query parameters.
   string
   search                             Search term which is accepted by the oVirt/RHV API.
   string                             For example to search for events of severity alert use the following pattern: severity=alert
   wait                Choices:
   boolean             • no           If True wait for the response.
                       • yes ←

NOTES                   *ovirt_event_info-notes*

   Note

     • In order to use this module you have to install oVirt Python SDK. To ensure it’s installed with correct version you can create the following task: pip: name=ovirt-engine-sdk-python
       version=4.3.0

EXAMPLES                   *ovirt_event_info-examples*

 # Examples don't contain the auth parameter for simplicity,
 # look at the ovirt_auth module to see how to reuse authentication.

 - name: Return all events
   ovirt_event_info:
   register: result

 - name: Return the last 10 events
   ovirt_event_info:
     max: 10
   register: result

 - name: Return all events of type alert
   ovirt_event_info:
     search: "severity=alert"
   register: result
 - debug:
     msg: "{{ result.ovirt_events }}"
