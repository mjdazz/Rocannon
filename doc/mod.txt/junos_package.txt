   force          Choices:
   boolean        • no ←         The force argument instructs the module to bypass the package version check and install the packaged identified in src on the remote device.

                                 A dict object containing connection details.
    host                         Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport. The value of host is used as the destination address for
    string /                     the transport.
    required
    password                     Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not specified
    string                       in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD will be used instead.
    port        Default:         Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device. The port value will default to the well known SSH port of 22 (for transport=cli) or
    integer     22               port 830 (for transport=netconf) device.
    ssh_keyfile                  Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is the path to the key used to authenticate the SSH session. If the
    path                         value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE will be used instead.
    timeout     Default:         Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before the
    integer     10               operation is completed, the module will error.
    username                     Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not
    string                       specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will be used instead.
   reboot         Choices:       In order for a package to take effect, the remote device must be restarted. When enabled, this argument will instruct the module to reboot the device once the
   boolean        • no           updated package has been installed. If disabled or the remote package does not need to be changed, the device will not be started.
                  • yes ←
   src                           The src argument specifies the path to the source package to be installed on the remote device in the advent of a version mismatch. The src argument can be either a
   - / required                  localized path or a full path to the package file to install.
                                 aliases: package
   validate       Choices:       The validate argument is responsible for instructing the remote device to skip checking the current device configuration compatibility with the package being
   boolean        • no           installed. When set to false validation is not performed.
   added in 2.5   • yes ←
   version                       The version argument can be used to explicitly specify the version of the package that should be installed on the remote device. If the version argument is not
   -                             specified, then the version is extracts from the src filename.
