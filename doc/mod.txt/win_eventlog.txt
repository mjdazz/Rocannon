   path
   retention_days                            The minimum number of days event entries must remain in the log.
   integer                                   This option is only used when overflow_action is OverwriteOlder.
   sources                                   A list of one or more sources to ensure are present/absent in the log.
   list                                      When category_file, message_file and/or parameter_file are specified, these values are applied across all sources.
