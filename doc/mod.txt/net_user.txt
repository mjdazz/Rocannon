DEPRECATED                   *net_user*

                         Removed in Ansible:
                  version: 2.13
        Why:      Updated modules released with more functionality
    Alternative:  Use platform-specific “[netos]_user” module

SYNOPSIS                   *net_user-synopsis*

     • This module provides declarative management of the local usernames configured on network devices. It allows playbooks to manage either individual usernames or the aggregate of usernames in
       the current running config. It also supports purging usernames from the configuration that are not explicitly defined.

PARAMETERS                   *net_user-parameters*

        Parameter      Choices/Defaults                                                                           Comments
   aggregate                            The set of username objects to be configured on the remote network device. The list entries can either be the username or a hash of username and properties.
   -                                    This argument is mutually exclusive with the name argument.
   configured_password                  The password to be configured on the remote network device. The password needs to be provided in clear and it will be encrypted on the device. Please note
   -                                    that this option is not same as provider password.
   name                                 The username to be configured on the remote network device. This argument accepts a string value and is mutually exclusive with the aggregate argument.
   -                                    Please note that this option is not same as provider username.
   nopassword            Choices:
   boolean               • no           Defines the username without assigning a password. This will allow the user to login to the system without being authenticated by a password.
                         • yes
   privilege                            The privilege argument configures the privilege level of the user when logged into the system. This argument accepts integer values in the range of 1 to 15.
   -
   purge                 Choices:       Instructs the module to consider the resource definition absolute. It will remove any previously configured usernames on the device with the exception of the
   boolean               • no ←         `admin` user (the current defined set of users).
                         • yes
   role                                 Configures the role for the username in the device running configuration. The argument accepts a string value defining the role name. This argument does not
   -                                    check if the role has been configured on the device.
   sshkey                               Specifies the SSH public key to configure for the given username. This argument accepts a valid SSH key value.
   -
   state                 Choices:       Configures the state of the username definition as it relates to the device operational configuration. When set to present, the username(s) should be
   -                     • present ←    configured in the device active configuration and when set to absent the username(s) should not be in the device active configuration
                         • absent
   update_password       Choices:       Since passwords are encrypted in the device running config, this argument will instruct the module when to change the password. When set to always, the
   -                     • on_create    password will always be updated in the device and when set to on_create the password will be updated only if the username is created.
                         • always ←
