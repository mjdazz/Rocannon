   string
   kubeconfig                                     Path to an existing Kubernetes config file. If not provided, and no other connection options are provided, the openshift client will attempt to

   upload_host_validate_certs   Choices:          Whether or not to verify the CDI Upload Proxy's SSL certificates against your system's CA trust store.
   boolean                      • no              aliases: upload_host_verify_ssl

   username                                       Provide a username for authenticating with the API. Can also be specified via K8S_AUTH_USERNAME environment variable.
   string                                         Please note that this only works with clusters configured to use HTTP Basic Auth. If your cluster has a different form of authentication (e.g.
                                                  OAuth2 in OpenShift), this option will not work as expected and you should look into the k8s_auth module, as that might do what you need.
   validate_certs               Choices:          Whether or not to verify the API server's SSL certificates. Can also be specified via K8S_AUTH_VERIFY_SSL environment variable.
   boolean                      • no              aliases: verify_ssl
                                • yes

NOTES                   *kubevirt_cdi_upload-notes*

   Note

     • The OpenShift Python client wraps the K8s Python client, providing full access to all of the APIS and models available on both platforms. For API version details and additional information
       visit https://github.com/openshift/openshift-restclient-python
     • To avoid SSL certificate validation errors when validate_certs is True, the full certificate chain for the API server must be provided via ca_cert or in the kubeconfig file.
