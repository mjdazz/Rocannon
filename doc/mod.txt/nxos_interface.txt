NOTES                   *nxos_interface-notes*

   Note

     • Tested against NXOSv 7.3.(0)D1(1) on VIRL
     • This module is also used to create logical interfaces such as svis and loopbacks.
     • Be cautious of platform specific idiosyncrasies. For example, when you default a loopback interface, the admin state toggles on certain versions of NX-OS.
     • The nxos_overlay_global anycast_gateway_mac attribute must be set before setting the fabric_forwarding_anycast_gateway property.
     • For information on using CLI and NX-API see the NXOS Platform Options guide
     • For more information on using Ansible to manage network devices see the Ansible Network Guide
     • For more information on using Ansible to manage Cisco devices see the Cisco integration page.
