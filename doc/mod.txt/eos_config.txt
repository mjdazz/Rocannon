SYNOPSIS                   *eos_config*

     • Arista EOS configurations use a simple block indent file syntax for segmenting configuration into sections. This module provides an implementation for working with EOS configuration sections
       in a deterministic way. This module works with either CLI or eAPI transports.

   after                              The ordered set of commands to append to the end of the command stack if a change needs to be made. Just like with before this allows the playbook designer to
   -                                  append a set of commands to be executed after the command set.

                                      Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using connection: network_cli and become: yes with become_pass.
                                      This option is only required if you are using eAPI.

                                      Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device. If authorize is false, then this argument does nothing. If the value

                                      Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands. If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all
                                      commands in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE will be used instead.
   backup              Choices:       This argument will cause the module to create a full backup of the current running-config from the remote device before any changes are made. If the
   boolean             • no ←         backup_options value is not given, the backup file is written to the backup folder in the playbook root directory or role root directory, if playbook is part
                       • yes          of an ansible role. If the directory does not exist, it is created.
   backup_options                     This is a dict object containing configurable options related to backup file path. The value of this option is read only when backup is set to yes, if backup
   dictionary                         is set to no this option will be silently ignored.
   added in 2.8
     dir_path                         This option provides the path ending with directory name in which the backup configuration file will be stored. If the directory does not exist it will be
     path                             first created and the filename is either the value of filename or default filename as described in filename options description. If the path value is not given
                                      in that case a backup directory will be created in the current working directory and backup configuration will be copied in filename within backup directory.
     filename                         The filename to be used to store the backup configuration. If the the filename is not given it will be generated based on the hostname, current time and date

   -                                  configuration commands prior to pushing any changes without affecting how the set of commands are matched against the system.
   defaults            Choices:       The defaults argument will influence how the running-config is collected from the device. When the value is set to true, the command used to collect the
   boolean             • no ←         running-config is append with the all keyword. When the value is set to false, the command is issued without the all keyword

                                      When this option is configured as session, the diff returned will be based on the configuration session.
   diff_ignore_lines                  Use this argument to specify one or more lines that should be ignored during the diff. This is used for lines in the configuration that are automatically

   src                                The src argument provides a path to the configuration file to load into the remote system. The path can either be a full system path to the configuration file
   -                                  if the value starts with / or relative to the root of the implemented role or playbook. This argument is mutually exclusive with the lines and parents
                                      arguments. It can be a Jinja2 template as well. src file must have same indentation as a live switch config. Arista EOS device config has 3 spaces indentation.
