SYNOPSIS                   *bigip_dns_nameserver*

     • Manages LTM DNS nameservers on a BIG-IP. These nameservers form part of what is known as DNS Express on a BIG-IP. This module does not configure GTM related functionality, nor does it
       configure system-level name servers that affect the base system’s ability to resolve DNS names.

NOTES                   *bigip_dns_nameserver-notes*

   Note

     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
