SYNOPSIS                   *bigip_snmp_community*

     • Assists in managing SNMP communities on a BIG-IP. Different SNMP versions are supported by this module. Take note of the different parameters offered by this module, as different parameters
       work for different versions of SNMP. Typically this becomes an interest if you are mixing versions v2c and 3.

PARAMETERS                   *bigip_snmp_community-parameters*

         Parameter       Choices/Defaults                                                                          Comments

   access                  • ro           When creating a new community, if this parameter is not specified, the default is ro.
   string                  • rw           When ro, specifies that the user can view the MIB, but cannot modify the MIB.
                           • read-only    When rw, specifies that the user can view and modify the MIB.
                           • read-write

   string                                 This parameter is only relevant when version is v1, or v2c. If version is something else, this parameter is ignored.
   ip_version              Choices:       Specifies whether the record applies to IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.
   string                  • 4            When creating a new community, if this value is not specified, the default of 4 will be used.

   string                                 The name public is a reserved name on the BIG-IP. This module handles that name differently than others. Functionally, you should not see a difference
                                          however.
   oid                                    Specifies the object identifier (OID) for the record.

NOTES                   *bigip_snmp_community-notes*

   Note

     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
