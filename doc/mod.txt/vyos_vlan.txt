   aggregate                              List of VLANs definitions.
   -
   associated_interfaces                  This is a intent option and checks the operational state of the for given vlan name for associated interfaces. If the value in the associated_interfaces
   -                                      does not match with the operational state of vlan on device it will result in failure.

                                          A dict object containing connection details.
      host                                Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport. The value of host is used as the destination
      string / required                   address for the transport.
      password                            Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not
      string                              specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD will be used instead.
      port               Default:         Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device.
      integer            22
      ssh_keyfile                         Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is the path to the key used to authenticate the SSH session.
      path                                If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE will be used instead.
      timeout            Default:         Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before the
      integer            10               operation is completed, the module will error.
      username                            Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not
      string                              specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will be used instead.
   purge                   Choices:
   boolean                 • no ←         Purge VLANs not defined in the aggregate parameter.
                           • yes
   state                   Choices:
   -                       • present ←    State of the VLAN configuration.
                           • absent
   vlan_id                                ID of the VLAN. Range 0-4094.
