                                                 Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using connection: network_cli.
                                                 This option is only required if you are using NX-API.

                                                 A dict object containing connection details.
          auth_pass                              Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device. If authorize is false, then this argument does nothing. If
          string                                 the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS will be used instead.
          added in 2.5.3
          authorize               Choices:       Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands. If not specified, the device will attempt to execute
          boolean                 • no ←         all commands in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE will be used
          added in 2.5.3          • yes          instead.
          host                                   Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport. The value of host is used as the
          string / required                      destination address for the transport.
          password                               Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This is a common argument used for either cli or nxapi
          string                                 transports. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD will be used instead.
          port                  Default:         Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device. This value applies to either cli or nxapi. The port value will default
          integer               "0 (use common   to the appropriate transport common port if none is provided in the task. (cli=22, http=80, https=443).
                                port)"
          ssh_keyfile                            Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This argument is only used for the cli transport. If the value is
          string                                 not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE will be used instead.
          timeout               Default:         Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded
          integer               10               before the operation is completed, the module will error. NX-API can be slow to return on long-running commands (sh mac, sh bgp, etc).
          transport               Choices:       Configures the transport connection to use when connecting to the remote device. The transport argument supports connectivity to the device over cli
          string / required       • cli ←        (ssh) or nxapi.
                                  • nxapi
          use_proxy               Choices:
          boolean                 • no           If no, the environment variables http_proxy and https_proxy will be ignored.
          added in 2.5            • yes ←
          use_ssl                 Choices:
          boolean                 • no ←         Configures the transport to use SSL if set to yes only when the transport=nxapi, otherwise this value is ignored.
                                  • yes
          username                               Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate either the CLI login or the
          string                                 nxapi authentication depending on which transport is used. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable
                                                 ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will be used instead.
          validate_certs          Choices:       If no, SSL certificates will not be validated. This should only be used on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. If the
          boolean                 • no           transport argument is not nxapi, this value is ignored.
                                  • yes ←
   role_priority                                 Role priority for device. Remember lower is better.
   -
   state                          Choices:
   - / required                   • present      Manages desired state of the resource
                                  • absent
   system_priority                               System priority device. Remember they must match between peers.

NOTES                   *nxos_vpc-notes*

   Note

     • Tested against NXOSv 7.3.(0)D1(1) on VIRL
     • The feature vpc must be enabled before this module can be used
     • If not using management vrf, vrf must be globally on the device before using in the pkl config
     • Although source IP isn’t required on the command line it is required when using this module. The PKL VRF must also be configured prior to using this module.
     • Both pkl_src and pkl_dest are needed when changing PKL VRF.
     • For information on using CLI and NX-API see the NXOS Platform Options guide
     • For more information on using Ansible to manage network devices see the Ansible Network Guide
