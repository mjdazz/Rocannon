SYNOPSIS                   *gce_lb*

     • This module can create and destroy Google Compute Engine loadbalancer and httphealthcheck resources. The primary LB resource is the load_balancer resource and the health check parameters are
       all prefixed with httphealthcheck. The full documentation for Google Compute Engine load balancing is at https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/. However, the ansible
       module simplifies the configuration by following the libcloud model. Full install/configuration instructions for the gce" modules can be found in the comments of ansible/test/gce_tests.py.
