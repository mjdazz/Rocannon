PARAMETERS                   *bigiq_application_https_offload-parameters*

        Parameter      Choices/Defaults                                                                           Comments
   add_analytics         Choices:       Collects statistics of the BIG-IP that the application is deployed to.
   boolean               • no ←         This parameter is only relevant when specifying a service_environment which is a BIG-IP; not an SSG.
                         • yes
   client_ssl_profile                   Specifies the SSL profile for managing client-side SSL traffic.
   dictionary
                                        One or more certificates and keys to associate with the SSL profile.
                                        This option is always a list. The keys in the list dictate the details of the client/key/chain/passphrase combination.
      cert_key_chain                    Note that BIG-IPs can only have one of each type of each certificate/key type. This means that you can only have one RSA, one DSA, and one ECDSA per profile.
      raw                               If you attempt to assign two RSA, DSA, or ECDSA certificate/key combo, the device will reject this.
                                        This list is a complex list that specifies a number of keys.

NOTES                   *bigiq_application_https_offload-notes*

   Note

     • This module will not work on BIGIQ version 6.1.x or greater.
     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
