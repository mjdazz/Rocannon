SYNOPSIS                   *gcp_compute_global_forwarding_rule*

     • Represents a GlobalForwardingRule resource. Global forwarding rules are used to forward traffic to the correct load balancer for HTTP load balancing. Global forwarding rules can only be used
       for HTTP load balancing.
     • For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/http/ .

   description                                 An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.
   string
   env_type                                    Specifies which Ansible environment you're running this module within.
   string                                      This should not be set unless you know what you're doing.
                                               This only alters the User Agent string for any API requests.
                                               The IP address that this forwarding rule is serving on behalf of.
                                               Addresses are restricted based on the forwarding rule's load balancing scheme (EXTERNAL or INTERNAL) and scope (global or regional).
                                               When the load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL, for global forwarding rules, the address must be a global IP, and for regional forwarding rules, the
                                               address must live in the same region as the forwarding rule. If this field is empty, an ephemeral IPv4 address from the same scope (global or
   ip_address                                  regional) will be assigned. A regional forwarding rule supports IPv4 only. A global forwarding rule supports either IPv4 or IPv6.
   string                                      When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, this can only be an RFC 1918 IP address belonging to the network/subnet configured for the forwarding
                                               rule. By default, if this field is empty, an ephemeral internal IP address will be automatically allocated from the IP range of the subnet or network
                                               configured for this forwarding rule.
                                               An address can be specified either by a literal IP address or a URL reference to an existing Address resource. The following examples are all valid: "
                                               100.1.2.3 " https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/regions/region/addresses/address "

   ip_protocol                                 The IP protocol to which this rule applies. Valid options are TCP, UDP, ESP, AH, SCTP or ICMP. When the load balancing scheme is
   string                                      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED, only TCP is valid.
                                               Some valid choices include: "TCP", "UDP", "ESP", "AH", "SCTP", "ICMP"
   ip_version                                  The IP Version that will be used by this global forwarding rule.
   string                                      Valid options are IPV4 or IPV6.
                                               Some valid choices include: "IPV4", "IPV6"
                                               This signifies what the GlobalForwardingRule will be used for.
   load_balancing_scheme    Default:           The value of INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED means that this will be used for Internal Global HTTP(S) LB. The value of EXTERNAL means that this will be used for
   string                   "EXTERNAL"         External Global Load Balancing (HTTP(S) LB, External TCP/UDP LB, SSL Proxy) NOTE: Currently global forwarding rules cannot be used for INTERNAL load
                                               balancing.

   name                                        Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
   string / required                           Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]"[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must
                                               be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
                                               This field is not used for external load balancing.
                                               For INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED load balancing, this field identifies the network that the load balanced IP should belong to for this global forwarding
   network                                     rule. If this field is not specified, the default network will be used.
   dictionary                                  This field represents a link to a Network resource in GCP. It can be specified in two ways. First, you can place a dictionary with key 'selfLink' and
                                               value of your resource's selfLink Alternatively, you can add `register: name-of-resource` to a gcp_compute_network task and then set this network
                                               field to "{{ name-of-resource }}"
                                               This field is used along with the target field for TargetHttpProxy, TargetHttpsProxy, TargetSslProxy, TargetTcpProxy, TargetVpnGateway, TargetPool,
                                               TargetInstance.

   string                                      Forwarding rules with the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair must have disjoint port ranges.
                                               Some types of forwarding target have constraints on the acceptable ports: " TargetHttpProxy: 80, 8080 " TargetHttpsProxy: 443 " TargetTcpProxy: 25,
