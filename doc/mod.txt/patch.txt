PARAMETERS                   *patch-parameters*

      Parameter    Choices/Defaults                                                                             Comments
   backup            Choices:
   boolean           • no ←         Passes --backup --version-control=numbered to patch, producing numbered backup copies.
                     • yes
   basedir                          Path of a base directory in which the patch file will be applied.
   path                             May be omitted when dest option is specified, otherwise required.
   binary            Choices:       Setting to yes will disable patch's heuristic for transforming CRLF line endings into LF.
   boolean           • no ←         Line endings of src and dest must match.
                     • yes          If set to no, patch will replace CRLF in src files on POSIX.
   dest                             Path of the file on the remote machine to be patched.
   path                             The names of the files to be patched are usually taken from the patch file, but if there's just one file to be patched it can specified with this option.
                                    aliases: originalfile
   remote_src        Choices:
   boolean           • no ←         If no, it will search for src at originating/master machine, if yes it will go to the remote/target machine for the src.
                     • yes
   src                              Path of the patch file as accepted by the GNU patch tool. If remote_src is 'no', the patch source file is looked up from the module's files directory.
   path / required                  aliases: patchfile
   state             Choices:
   string            • absent       Whether the patch should be applied or reverted.
   added in 2.6      • present ←
   strip           Default:         Number that indicates the smallest prefix containing leading slashes that will be stripped from each file name found in the patch file.
   integer         0                For more information see the strip parameter of the GNU patch tool.
