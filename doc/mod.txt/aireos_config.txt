SYNOPSIS                   *aireos_config*

     • AireOS does not use a block indent file syntax, so there are no sections or parents. This module provides an implementation for working with AireOS configurations in a deterministic way.

Parameters¶

       Parameter     Choices/Defaults                                                                            Comments
   after                              The ordered set of commands to append to the end of the command stack if a change needs to be made. Just like with before this allows the playbook designer to
   -                                  append a set of commands to be executed after the command set.
   backup              Choices:       This argument will cause the module to create a full backup of the current running-config from the remote device before any changes are made. If the
   boolean             • no ←         backup_options value is not given, the backup file is written to the backup folder in the playbook root directory. If the directory does not exist, it is
                       • yes          created.
   backup_options                     This is a dict object containing configurable options related to backup file path. The value of this option is read only when backup is set to yes, if backup
   dictionary                         is set to no this option will be silently ignored.
   added in 2.8
      dir_path                        This option provides the path ending with directory name in which the backup configuration file will be stored. If the directory does not exist it will be
      path                            first created and the filename is either the value of filename or default filename as described in filename options description. If the path value is not given
                                      in that case a backup directory will be created in the current working directory and backup configuration will be copied in filename within backup directory.
      filename                        The filename to be used to store the backup configuration. If the the filename is not given it will be generated based on the hostname, current time and date
      -                               in format defined by <hostname>_config.<current-date>@<current-time>
   before                             The ordered set of commands to push on to the command stack if a change needs to be made. This allows the playbook designer the opportunity to perform
   -                                  configuration commands prior to pushing any changes without affecting how the set of commands are matched against the system.
                                      When using the ansible-playbook --diff command line argument the module can generate diffs against different sources.
   diff_against        Choices:       When this option is configured as intended, the module will return the diff of the running-config against the configuration provided in the intended_config
   -                   • intended     argument.
                       • running      When this option is configured as running, the module will return the before and after diff of the running-config with respect to any changes made to the
                                      device configuration.
   diff_ignore_lines                  Use this argument to specify one or more lines that should be ignored during the diff. This is used for lines in the configuration that are automatically
   -                                  updated by the system. This argument takes a list of regular expressions or exact line matches.
   intended_config                    The intended_config provides the master configuration that the node should conform to and is used to check the final running-config against. This argument will
   -                                  not modify any settings on the remote device and is strictly used to check the compliance of the current device's configuration against. When specifying this
                                      argument, the task should also modify the diff_against value and set it to intended.
   lines                              The ordered set of commands that should be configured. The commands must be the exact same commands as found in the device run-config. Be sure to note the
   -                                  configuration command syntax as some commands are automatically modified by the device config parser.
                                      aliases: commands
   match               Choices:       Instructs the module on the way to perform the matching of the set of commands against the current device config. If match is set to line, commands are matched
   -                   • line ←       line by line. If match is set to none, the module will not attempt to compare the source configuration with the running configuration on the remote device.
                       • none
   provider                           A dict object containing connection details.
   -
      host                            Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport.
      string /                        The value of host is used as the destination address for the transport.
      required
      password                        Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.
      string                          This value is used to authenticate the SSH session.
                                      If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD will be used instead.
      port           Default:         Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device.
      integer        22
      ssh_keyfile                     Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.
      path                            This value is the path to the key used to authenticate the SSH session.
                                      If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE will be used instead.
      timeout        Default:         Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands.
      integer        10               If the timeout is exceeded before the operation is completed, the module will error.
      username                        Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.
      string                          This value is used to authenticate the SSH session.
                                      If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will be used instead.
                                      The module, by default, will connect to the remote device and retrieve the current running-config to use as a base for comparing against the contents of
   running_config                     source. There are times when it is not desirable to have the task get the current running-config for every task in a playbook. The running_config argument
   -                                  allows the implementer to pass in the configuration to use as the base config for comparison.
                                      aliases: config
                       Choices:       The save argument instructs the module to save the running-config to startup-config. This operation is performed after any changes are made to the current
   save                • no ←         running config. If no changes are made, the configuration is still saved to the startup config. This option will always cause the module to return changed.
   boolean             • yes          This argument is mutually exclusive with save_when.
                                      This option is deprecated as of Ansible 2.7, use save_when
   save_when           Choices:       When changes are made to the device running-configuration, the changes are not copied to non-volatile storage by default. Using this argument will change that.
   -                   • always       If the argument is set to always, then the running-config will always be copied to the startup-config and the module will always return as changed. If the
   added in 2.7        • never ←      argument is set to never, the running-config will never be copied to the startup-config. If the argument is set to changed, then the running-config will only
                       • changed      be copied to the startup-config if the task has made a change.
   src                                Specifies the source path to the file that contains the configuration or configuration template to load. The path to the source file can either be the full
   -                                  path on the Ansible control host or a relative path from the playbook or role root directory. This argument is mutually exclusive with lines.
