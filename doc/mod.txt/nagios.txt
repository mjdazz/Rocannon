SYNOPSIS                   *nagios*

     • The nagios module has two basic functions: scheduling downtime and toggling alerts for services or hosts.
     • All actions require the host parameter to be given explicitly. In playbooks you can use the {{inventory_hostname}} variable to refer to the host the playbook is currently running on.
     • You can specify multiple services at once by separating them with commas, .e.g., services=httpd,nfs,puppet.
     • When specifying what service to handle there is a special service value, host, which will handle alerts/downtime for the host itself, e.g., service=host. This keyword may not be given with
       other services at the same time. Setting alerts/downtime for a host does not affect alerts/downtime for any of the services running on it. To schedule downtime for all services on particular
       host use keyword “all”, e.g., service=all.
     • When using the nagios module you will need to specify your Nagios server using the delegate_to parameter.
