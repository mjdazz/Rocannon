NOTES                   *ovirt_job-notes*

   Note

     • In order to use this module you have to install oVirt Python SDK. To ensure it’s installed with correct version you can create the following task: pip: name=ovirt-engine-sdk-python
       version=4.3.0

EXAMPLES                   *ovirt_job-examples*

 # Examples don't contain auth parameter for simplicity,
 # look at ovirt_auth module to see how to reuse authentication:

 - name: Create job with two steps
   ovirt_job:
     description: job_name
     steps:
       - description: step_name_A
       - description: step_name_B

 - name: Finish one step
   ovirt_job:
     description: job_name
     steps:
       - description: step_name_A
         state: finished

 - name: When you fail one step whole job will stop
   ovirt_job:
     description: job_name
     steps:
       - description: step_name_B
         state: failed

 - name: Finish all steps
   ovirt_job:
     description: job_name
     state: finished
