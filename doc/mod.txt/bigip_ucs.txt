         integer                                 before the operation is completed, the module will error.
         transport                Choices:

   reset_trust                    Choices:
   boolean                        • no           When specified, the device and trust domain certs and keys are not loaded from the UCS. Instead, a new set is regenerated.

                                  Choices:       When installed, ensures that the UCS is uploaded and installed, on the system. When present, ensures that the UCS is uploaded. When absent, the UCS
   state                          • absent       will be removed from the system. When installed, the uploading of the UCS is idempotent, however the installation of that configuration is not
   string                         • installed    idempotent.
                                  • present ←
   ucs                                           The path to the UCS file to install. The parameter must be provided if the state is either installed or activated. When state is absent, the full
   string                                        path for this parameter will be ignored and only the filename will be used to select a UCS for removal. Therefore you could specify
                                                 /mickey/mouse/test.ucs and this module would only look for test.ucs.

NOTES                   *bigip_ucs-notes*

   Note

     • Only the most basic checks are performed by this module. Other checks and considerations need to be taken into account. See the following URL.
       https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/solutions/public/11000/300/sol11318.html
     • This module does not handle devices with the FIPS 140 HSM
     • This module does not handle BIG-IPs systems on the 6400, 6800, 8400, or 8800 hardware platform.
     • This module does not verify that the new or replaced SSH keys from the UCS file are synchronized between the BIG-IP system and the SCCP
     • This module does not support the ‘rma’ option
     • This module does not support restoring a UCS archive on a BIG-IP 1500, 3400, 4100, 6400, 6800, or 8400 hardware platform other than the system from which the backup was created
     • The UCS restore operation restores the full configuration only if the hostname of the target system matches the hostname on which the UCS archive was created. If the hostname does not match,
       only the shared configuration is restored. You can ensure hostnames match by using the bigip_hostname Ansible module in a task before using this module.
     • This module does not support re-licensing a BIG-IP restored from a UCS
     • This module does not support restoring encrypted archives on replacement RMA units.
     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
