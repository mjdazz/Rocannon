SYNOPSIS                   *os_image_info*

     • Retrieve information about a image image from OpenStack.
     • This module was called os_image_facts before Ansible 2.9, returning ansible_facts. Note that the os_image_info module no longer returns ansible_facts!

   Aliases: os_image_facts

PARAMETERS                   *os_image_info-parameters*

       Parameter     Choices/Defaults                                                                            Comments
   api_timeout                        How long should the socket layer wait before timing out for API calls. If this is omitted, nothing will be passed to the requests library.
   integer
                                      Dictionary containing auth information as needed by the cloud's auth plugin strategy. For the default password plugin, this would contain auth_url, username,
   auth                               password, project_name and any information about domains (for example, os_user_domain_name or os_project_domain_name) if the cloud supports them. For other
   dictionary                         plugins, this param will need to contain whatever parameters that auth plugin requires. This parameter is not needed if a named cloud is provided or OpenStack
                                      OS_" environment variables are present.
   auth_type                          Name of the auth plugin to use. If the cloud uses something other than password authentication, the name of the plugin should be indicated here and the
   string                             contents of the auth parameter should be updated accordingly.
   availability_zone                  Ignored. Present for backwards compatibility

   ca_cert                            A path to a CA Cert bundle that can be used as part of verifying SSL API requests.
   string                             aliases: cacert
   client_cert                        A path to a client certificate to use as part of the SSL transaction.
   string                             aliases: cert
   client_key                         A path to a client key to use as part of the SSL transaction.
   string                             aliases: key
   cloud                              Named cloud or cloud config to operate against. If cloud is a string, it references a named cloud config as defined in an OpenStack clouds.yaml file. Provides
   raw                                default values for auth and auth_type. This parameter is not needed if auth is provided or if OpenStack OS_" environment variables are present. If cloud is a
                                      dict, it contains a complete cloud configuration like would be in a section of clouds.yaml.
   image                              Name or ID of the image

NOTES                   *os_image_info-notes*

   Note

     • The standard OpenStack environment variables, such as OS_USERNAME may be used instead of providing explicit values.
     • Auth information is driven by openstacksdk, which means that values can come from a yaml config file in /etc/ansible/openstack.yaml, /etc/openstack/clouds.yaml or
       ~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml, then from standard environment variables, then finally by explicit parameters in plays. More information can be found at
       https://docs.openstack.org/openstacksdk/
