NOTES                   *meraki_organization-notes*

   Note

     • More information about the Meraki API can be found at https://dashboard.meraki.com/api_docs.
     • Some of the options are likely only used for developers within Meraki.
     • As of Ansible 2.9, Meraki modules output keys as snake case. To use camel case, set the ANSIBLE_MERAKI_FORMAT environment variable to camelcase.
     • Ansible’s Meraki modules will stop supporting camel case output in Ansible 2.13. Please update your playbooks.
