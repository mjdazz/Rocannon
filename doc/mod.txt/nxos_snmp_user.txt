     • Manages SNMP user configuration.

PARAMETERS                   *nxos_snmp_user-parameters*

      Parameter    Choices/Defaults                                                                             Comments
   authentication    Choices:
   -                 • md5          Authentication parameters for the user.
                     • sha
   encrypt           Choices:
   boolean           • no           Enables AES-128 bit encryption when using privacy password.
                     • yes
   group                            Group to which the user will belong to. If state = present, and the user is existing, the group is added to the user. If the user is not existing, user entry is
   -                                created with this group argument. If state = absent, only the group is removed from the user entry. However, to maintain backward compatibility, if the existing
                                    user belongs to only one group, and if group argument is same as the existing user's group, then the user entry also is deleted.
   privacy                          Privacy password for the user. This is not idempotent

                                    Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using connection: network_cli.
                                    This option is only required if you are using NX-API.

                                    A dict object containing connection details.
    auth_pass                       Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device. If authorize is false, then this argument does nothing. If the value is
    string                          not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS will be used instead.
    added in 2.5.3
    authorize        Choices:       Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands. If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all commands
    boolean          • no ←         in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE will be used instead.
    added in 2.5.3   • yes
    host                            Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport. The value of host is used as the destination address for
    string /                        the transport.
    required
    password                        Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This is a common argument used for either cli or nxapi transports. If the
    string                          value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD will be used instead.
    port           Default:         Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device. This value applies to either cli or nxapi. The port value will default to the
    integer        "0 (use common   appropriate transport common port if none is provided in the task. (cli=22, http=80, https=443).
                   port)"
    ssh_keyfile                     Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This argument is only used for the cli transport. If the value is not specified
    string                          in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE will be used instead.
    timeout        Default:         Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before the
    integer        10               operation is completed, the module will error. NX-API can be slow to return on long-running commands (sh mac, sh bgp, etc).
    transport        Choices:       Configures the transport connection to use when connecting to the remote device. The transport argument supports connectivity to the device over cli (ssh) or
    string /         • cli ←        nxapi.
    required         • nxapi
    use_proxy        Choices:
    boolean          • no           If no, the environment variables http_proxy and https_proxy will be ignored.
    added in 2.5     • yes ←
    use_ssl          Choices:
    boolean          • no ←         Configures the transport to use SSL if set to yes only when the transport=nxapi, otherwise this value is ignored.
                     • yes
    username                        Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate either the CLI login or the nxapi
    string                          authentication depending on which transport is used. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will be
                                    used instead.
    validate_certs   Choices:       If no, SSL certificates will not be validated. This should only be used on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. If the transport argument
    boolean          • no           is not nxapi, this value is ignored.
                     • yes ←
   pwd                              Authentication password when using md5 or sha. This is not idempotent
   -
   state             Choices:
   -                 • present ←    Manage the state of the resource.
                     • absent
   user                             Name of the user.
