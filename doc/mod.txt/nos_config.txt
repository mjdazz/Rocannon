SYNOPSIS                   *nos_config*

     • Extreme NOS configurations use a simple block indent file syntax for segmenting configuration into sections. This module provides an implementation for working with NOS configuration
       sections in a deterministic way.

PARAMETERS                   *nos_config-parameters*

        Parameter      Choices/Defaults                                                                           Comments
   after                                The ordered set of commands to append to the end of the command stack if a change needs to be made. Just like with before this allows the playbook designer
   -                                    to append a set of commands to be executed after the command set.
   backup                Choices:       This argument will cause the module to create a full backup of the current running-config from the remote device before any changes are made. If the
   boolean               • no ←         backup_options value is not given, the backup file is written to the backup folder in the playbook root directory. If the directory does not exist, it is
                         • yes          created.
   backup_options                       This is a dict object containing configurable options related to backup file path. The value of this option is read only when backup is set to yes, if backup
   dictionary                           is set to no this option will be silently ignored.
   added in 2.8
                                        This option provides the path ending with directory name in which the backup configuration file will be stored. If the directory does not exist it will be
          dir_path                      first created and the filename is either the value of filename or default filename as described in filename options description. If the path value is not
          path                          given in that case a backup directory will be created in the current working directory and backup configuration will be copied in filename within backup
                                        directory.
          filename                      The filename to be used to store the backup configuration. If the the filename is not given it will be generated based on the hostname, current time and date
          -                             in format defined by <hostname>_config.<current-date>@<current-time>
   before                               The ordered set of commands to push on to the command stack if a change needs to be made. This allows the playbook designer the opportunity to perform
   -                                    configuration commands prior to pushing any changes without affecting how the set of commands are matched against the system.
                                        When using the ansible-playbook --diff command line argument the module can generate diffs against different sources.
   diff_against          Choices:       When this option is configured as intended, the module will return the diff of the running-config against the configuration provided in the intended_config
   -                     • running      argument.
                         • intended     When this option is configured as running, the module will return the before and after diff of the running-config with respect to any changes made to the
                                        device configuration.
   diff_ignore_lines                    Use this argument to specify one or more lines that should be ignored during the diff. This is used for lines in the configuration that are automatically
   -                                    updated by the system. This argument takes a list of regular expressions or exact line matches.
   intended_config                      The intended_config provides the master configuration that the node should conform to and is used to check the final running-config against. This argument
   -                                    will not modify any settings on the remote device and is strictly used to check the compliance of the current device's configuration against. When specifying
                                        this argument, the task should also modify the diff_against value and set it to intended.
   lines                                The ordered set of commands that should be configured in the section. The commands must be the exact same commands as found in the device running-config. Be
   -                                    sure to note the configuration command syntax as some commands are automatically modified by the device config parser.
                                        aliases: commands
                         Choices:
   match                 • line ←       Instructs the module on the way to perform the matching of the set of commands against the current device config. If match is set to line, commands are
   -                     • strict       matched line by line. If match is set to strict, command lines are matched with respect to position. If match is set to exact, command lines must be an equal
                         • exact        match. Finally, if match is set to none, the module will not attempt to compare the source configuration with the running configuration on the remote device.
                         • none
   multiline_delimiter Default:         This argument is used when pushing a multiline configuration element to the NOS device. It specifies the character to use as the delimiting character. This
   -                   "@"              only applies to the configuration action.
   parents                              The ordered set of parents that uniquely identify the section or hierarchy the commands should be checked against. If the parents argument is omitted, the
   -                                    commands are checked against the set of top level or global commands.
   replace               Choices:       Instructs the module on the way to perform the configuration on the device. If the replace argument is set to line then the modified lines are pushed to the
   -                     • line ←       device in configuration mode. If the replace argument is set to block then the entire command block is pushed to the device in configuration mode if any line
                         • block        is not correct.
                                        The module, by default, will connect to the remote device and retrieve the current running-config to use as a base for comparing against the contents of
   running_config                       source. There are times when it is not desirable to have the task get the current running-config for every task in a playbook. The running_config argument
   -                                    allows the implementer to pass in the configuration to use as the base config for comparison.
                                        aliases: config
   src                                  Specifies the source path to the file that contains the configuration or configuration template to load. The path to the source file can either be the full
   -                                    path on the Ansible control host or a relative path from the playbook or role root directory. This argument is mutually exclusive with lines, parents.
