PARAMETERS                   *bigip_device_traffic_group-parameters*

       Parameter      Choices/Defaults                                                                            Comments
   auto_failback        Choices:
   boolean              • no           Specifies whether the traffic group fails back to the initial device specified in ha_order.
   added in 2.8         • yes
   auto_failback_time                  Specifies the number of seconds the system delays before failing back to the initial device specified in ha_order.
   integer                             The correct value range is 0 - 300 inclusive.
   added in 2.8
                                       Specifies a configured HA group to be associated with the traffic group.
   ha_group                            Once you create an HA group on a device and associate the HA group with a traffic group, you must create an HA group and associate it with that same traffic
   string                              group on every device in the device group.
   added in 2.8                        To disable an HA group failover method , specify an empty string value ("") to this parameter.
                                       Disabling HA group will revert the device back to using Load Aware method as it is the default, unless ha_order setting is also configured.
                                       The auto_failback and auto_failback_time are not compatible with ha_group.
   ha_load_factor                      The value of the load the traffic-group presents the system relative to other traffic groups.
   integer                             This parameter only takes effect when Load Aware failover method is in use.
   added in 2.8                        The correct value range is 1 - 1000 inclusive.
                                       Specifies order in which you would like to assign devices for failover.
                                       If you configure this setting, you must configure the setting on every traffic group in the device group.
                                       The values should be device names of the devices that belong to the failover group configured beforehand.
   ha_order                            The order in which the devices are placed as arguments to this parameter, determines their HA order on the device, in other words changing the order of the
   list                                same elements will cause a change on the unit.
   added in 2.8                        To disable an HA order failover method , specify an empty string value ("") to this parameter.
                                       Disabling HA order will revert the device back to using Load Aware method as it is the default, unless ha_group setting is also configured.
                                       Device names will be prepended by a partition by the module, so you can provide either the full path format name /Common/bigip1 or just the name string
                                       bigip1.
                                       Specifies the floating Media Access Control (MAC) address associated with the floating IP addresses defined for a traffic group.
                                       Primarily, a MAC masquerade address minimizes ARP communications or dropped packets as a result of failover.
   mac_address                         A MAC masquerade address ensures that any traffic destined for a specific traffic group reaches an available device after failover, which happens because
   string                              along with the traffic group, the MAC masquerade address floats to the available device.
   added in 2.6                        Without a MAC masquerade address, the sending host must learn the MAC address for a newly-active device, either by sending an ARP request or by relying on the
                                       gratuitous ARP from the newly-active device.
                                       To unset the MAC address, specify an empty value ("") to this parameter.
   name                                The name of the traffic group.
   string / required
   partition          Default:         Device partition to manage resources on.

     integer          443              You may omit this option by setting the environment variable F5_SERVER_PORT.
     ssh_keyfile                       Specifies the SSH keyfile to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This argument is only used for cli transports.
     path                              You may omit this option by setting the environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE.
     timeout                           Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before the
     integer                           operation is completed, the module will error.
     transport          Choices:
     string             • cli          Configures the transport connection to use when connecting to the remote device.

   Note

     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
