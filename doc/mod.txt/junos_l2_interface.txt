                                   A dict object containing connection details.
     host                          Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport. The value of host is used as the destination address for
     string /                      the transport.
     required
     password                      Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not
     string                        specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD will be used instead.
     port         Default:         Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device. The port value will default to the well known SSH port of 22 (for transport=cli) or
     integer      22               port 830 (for transport=netconf) device.
     ssh_keyfile                   Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is the path to the key used to authenticate the SSH session. If the
     path                          value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE will be used instead.
     timeout      Default:         Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before the
     integer      10               operation is completed, the module will error.
     username                      Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not
     string                        specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will be used instead.
   state            Choices:
   -                • present ←    State of the Layer-2 Interface configuration.
                    • absent
   trunk_vlans                     List of VLAN names to be configured in trunk port. The value of trunk_vlans should be list of vlan names.
   -
   unit           Default:         Logical interface number. Value of unit should be of type integer.

     • Tested against vqfx-10000 JUNOS Version 15.1X53-D60.4.
     • Recommended connection is netconf. See the Junos OS Platform Options.
     • This module also works with local connections for legacy playbooks.
