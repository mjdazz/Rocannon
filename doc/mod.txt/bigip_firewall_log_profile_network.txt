PARAMETERS                   *bigip_firewall_log_profile_network-parameters*

          Parameter             Choices/Defaults                                                                          Comments
                                                       Specifies the delimiter string when using a log_storage_format of field-list.
                                                       When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default value of , (the comma character) will be used.
   log_format_delimiter                                This option is valid when the log_storage_format is set to field-list. It will be ignored otherwise.
   string                                              Depending on the delimiter used, it may be necessary to wrap the delimiter in quotes to prevent YAML errors from occurring.
                                                       The special character $ should not be used, and will raise an error if used, as it is reserved for internal use.
                                                       The maximum length allowed for this parameter is 31 characters.

   Note

     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
