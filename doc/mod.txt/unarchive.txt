SYNOPSIS                   *unarchive*

     • The unarchive module unpacks an archive. It will not unpack a compressed file that does not contain an archive.
     • By default, it will copy the source file from the local system to the target before unpacking.
     • Set remote_src=yes to unpack an archive which already exists on the target.
     • If checksum validation is desired, use get_url or uri instead to fetch the file and set remote_src=yes.
     • For Windows targets, use the win_unzip module instead.

PARAMETERS                   *unarchive-parameters*

     Parameter    Choices/Defaults                                                                              Comments
                                   The attributes the resulting file or directory should have.
   attributes                      To get supported flags look at the man page for chattr on the target system.
   string                          This string should contain the attributes in the same order as the one displayed by lsattr.
                                   The = operator is assumed as default, otherwise + or - operators need to be included in the string.
                                   aliases: attr
   copy             Choices:       If true, the file is copied from local 'master' to the target machine, otherwise, the plugin will look for src archive at the target machine.
   boolean          • no           This option has been deprecated in favor of remote_src.
                    • yes ←        This option is mutually exclusive with remote_src.
   creates                         If the specified absolute path (file or directory) already exists, this step will not be run.
   path
   decrypt          Choices:
   boolean          • no           This option controls the autodecryption of source files using vault.
   added in 2.4     • yes ←
   dest
   path /                          Remote absolute path where the archive should be unpacked.
   required
   exclude                         List the directory and file entries that you would like to exclude from the unarchive action.
   list
   extra_opts     Default:         Specify additional options by passing in an array.
   list           ""               Each space-separated command-line option should be a new element of the array. See examples.
                                   Command-line options with multiple elements must use multiple lines in the array, one for each element.
   group                           Name of the group that should own the file/directory, as would be fed to chown.
   string
   keep_newer       Choices:
   boolean          • no ←         Do not replace existing files that are newer than files from the archive.
                    • yes
   list_files       Choices:
   boolean          • no ←         If set to True, return the list of files that are contained in the tarball.
                    • yes
                                   The permissions the resulting file or directory should have.
                                   For those used to /usr/bin/chmod remember that modes are actually octal numbers. You must either add a leading zero so that Ansible's YAML parser knows it is an
   mode                            octal number (like 0644 or 01777) or quote it (like '644' or '1777') so Ansible receives a string and can do its own conversion from string into number.
   string                          Giving Ansible a number without following one of these rules will end up with a decimal number which will have unexpected results.
                                   As of Ansible 1.8, the mode may be specified as a symbolic mode (for example, u+rwx or u=rw,g=r,o=r).
                                   As of Ansible 2.6, the mode may also be the special string preserve.
                                   When set to preserve the file will be given the same permissions as the source file.
   owner                           Name of the user that should own the file/directory, as would be fed to chown.
   string
   remote_src       Choices:       Set to yes to indicate the archived file is already on the remote system and not local to the Ansible controller.
   boolean          • no ←         This option is mutually exclusive with copy.
                    • yes
   selevel        Default:         The level part of the SELinux file context.
   string         "s0"             This is the MLS/MCS attribute, sometimes known as the range.
                                   When set to _default, it will use the level portion of the policy if available.
   serole                          The role part of the SELinux file context.
   string                          When set to _default, it will use the role portion of the policy if available.
   setype                          The type part of the SELinux file context.
   string                          When set to _default, it will use the type portion of the policy if available.
   seuser                          The user part of the SELinux file context.
   string                          By default it uses the system policy, where applicable.
                                   When set to _default, it will use the user portion of the policy if available.
   src                             If remote_src=no (default), local path to archive file to copy to the target server; can be absolute or relative. If remote_src=yes, path on the target server to
   path /                          existing archive file to unpack.
   required                        If remote_src=yes and src contains ://, the remote machine will download the file from the URL first. (version_added 2.0). This is only for simple cases, for full
                                   download support use the get_url module.
                                   Influence when to use atomic operation to prevent data corruption or inconsistent reads from the target file.
                                   By default this module uses atomic operations to prevent data corruption or inconsistent reads from the target files, but sometimes systems are configured or just
   unsafe_writes    Choices:       broken in ways that prevent this. One example is docker mounted files, which cannot be updated atomically from inside the container and can only be written in an
   boolean          • no ←         unsafe manner.
                    • yes          This option allows Ansible to fall back to unsafe methods of updating files when atomic operations fail (however, it doesn't force Ansible to perform unsafe
                                   writes).
                                   IMPORTANT! Unsafe writes are subject to race conditions and can lead to data corruption.
   validate_certs   Choices:       This only applies if using a https URL as the source of the file.
   boolean          • no           This should only set to no used on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificate.
                    • yes ←        Prior to 2.2 the code worked as if this was set to yes.

NOTES                   *unarchive-notes*

   Note

     • Requires zipinfo and gtar/unzip command on target host.
     • Can handle .zip files using unzip as well as .tar, .tar.gz, .tar.bz2 and .tar.xz files using gtar.
     • Does not handle .gz files, .bz2 files or .xz files that do not contain a .tar archive.
     • Uses gtar’s --diff arg to calculate if changed or not. If this arg is not supported, it will always unpack the archive.
     • Existing files/directories in the destination which are not in the archive are not touched. This is the same behavior as a normal archive extraction.
     • Existing files/directories in the destination which are not in the archive are ignored for purposes of deciding if the archive should be unpacked or not.
