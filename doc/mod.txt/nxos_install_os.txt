                                         Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using connection: network_cli.
                                         This option is only required if you are using NX-API.

                                         A dict object containing connection details.
     auth_pass                           Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device. If authorize is false, then this argument does nothing. If the
     string                              value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS will be used instead.
     added in 2.5.3
     authorize            Choices:       Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands. If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all
     boolean              • no ←         commands in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE will be used instead.
     added in 2.5.3       • yes
     host                                Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport. The value of host is used as the destination
     string / required                   address for the transport.
     password                            Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This is a common argument used for either cli or nxapi transports. If the
     string                              value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD will be used instead.
     port               Default:         Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device. This value applies to either cli or nxapi. The port value will default to the
     integer            "0 (use common   appropriate transport common port if none is provided in the task. (cli=22, http=80, https=443).
                        port)"
     ssh_keyfile                         Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This argument is only used for the cli transport. If the value is not
     string                              specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE will be used instead.
     timeout            Default:         Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before the
     integer            10               operation is completed, the module will error. NX-API can be slow to return on long-running commands (sh mac, sh bgp, etc).
     transport            Choices:       Configures the transport connection to use when connecting to the remote device. The transport argument supports connectivity to the device over cli (ssh)
     string / required    • cli ←        or nxapi.
                          • nxapi
     use_proxy            Choices:
     boolean              • no           If no, the environment variables http_proxy and https_proxy will be ignored.
     added in 2.5         • yes ←
     use_ssl              Choices:
     boolean              • no ←         Configures the transport to use SSL if set to yes only when the transport=nxapi, otherwise this value is ignored.
                          • yes
     username                            Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate either the CLI login or the nxapi
     string                              authentication depending on which transport is used. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will
                                         be used instead.
     validate_certs       Choices:       If no, SSL certificates will not be validated. This should only be used on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. If the transport
     boolean              • no           argument is not nxapi, this value is ignored.
                          • yes ←
   system_image_file                     Name of the system (or combined) image file on flash.

NOTES                   *nxos_install_os-notes*

   Note

     • Tested against the following platforms and images - N9k 7.0(3)I4(6), 7.0(3)I5(3), 7.0(3)I6(1), 7.0(3)I7(1), 7.0(3)F2(2), 7.0(3)F3(2) - N3k 6.0(2)A8(6), 6.0(2)A8(8), 7.0(3)I6(1), 7.0(3)I7(1)
       - N7k 7.3(0)D1(1), 8.0(1), 8.1(1), 8.2(1)
     • This module requires both the ANSIBLE_PERSISTENT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT and ANSIBLE_PERSISTENT_COMMAND_TIMEOUT timers to be set to 600 seconds or higher. The module will exit if the timers are not
       set properly.
     • When using connection local, ANSIBLE_PERSISTENT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT and ANSIBLE_PERSISTENT_COMMAND_TIMEOUT can only be set using ENV variables or the ansible.cfg file.
     • Do not include full file paths, just the name of the file(s) stored on the top level flash directory.
     • This module attempts to install the software immediately, which may trigger a reboot.
     • In check mode, the module will indicate if an upgrade is needed and whether or not the upgrade is disruptive or non-disruptive(ISSU).
