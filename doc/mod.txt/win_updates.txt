     • Searches, downloads, and installs Windows updates synchronously by automating the Windows Update client.

PARAMETERS                   *win_updates-parameters*

       Parameter       Choices/Defaults                                                                            Comments
   blacklist                              A list of update titles or KB numbers that can be used to specify which updates are to be excluded from installation.
   list                                   If an available update does match one of the entries, then it is skipped and not installed.
   added in 2.5                           Each entry can either be the KB article or Update title as a regex according to the PowerShell regex rules.
                      Default:            A scalar or list of categories to install updates from. To get the list of categories, run the module with state=searched. The category must be the full
   category_names     ["CriticalUpdates", category string, but is case insensitive.
   list               "SecurityUpdates",  Some possible categories are Application, Connectors, Critical Updates, Definition Updates, Developer Kits, Feature Packs, Guidance, Security Updates,
                      "UpdateRollups"]    Service Packs, Tools, Update Rollups and Updates.
   log_path                               If set, win_updates will append update progress to the specified file. The directory must already exist.
   path
   reboot               Choices:          Ansible will automatically reboot the remote host if it is required and continue to install updates after the reboot.
   boolean              • no ←            This can be used instead of using a win_reboot task after this one and ensures all updates for that category is installed in one go.
   added in 2.5         • yes             Async does not work when reboot=yes.
   reboot_timeout     Default:            The time in seconds to wait until the host is back online from a reboot.
   -                  1200                This is only used if reboot=yes and a reboot is required.
   added in 2.5
                                          Defines the Windows Update source catalog.
                        Choices:          default Use the default search source. For many systems default is set to the Microsoft Windows Update catalog. Systems participating in Windows Server
   server_selection     • default ←       Update Services (WSUS), Systems Center Configuration Manager (SCCM), or similar corporate update server environments may default to those managed update
   string               • managed_server  sources instead of the Windows Update catalog.
   added in 2.8         • windows_update  managed_server Use a managed server catalog. For environments utilizing Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), Systems Center Configuration Manager (SCCM),
                                          or similar corporate update servers, this option selects the defined corporate update source.
                                          windows_update Use the Microsoft Windows Update catalog.
                        Choices:
   state                • installed ←     Controls whether found updates are downloaded or installed or listed
   string               • searched        This module also supports Ansible check mode, which has the same effect as setting state=searched
                        • downloaded
   use_scheduled_task   Choices:          Will not auto elevate the remote process with become and use a scheduled task instead.
   boolean              • no ←            Set this to yes when using this module with async on Server 2008, 2008 R2, or Windows 7, or on Server 2008 that is not authenticated with basic or credssp.
   added in 2.6         • yes             Can also be set to yes on newer hosts where become does not work due to further privilege restrictions from the OS defaults.
                                          A list of update titles or KB numbers that can be used to specify which updates are to be searched or installed.
   whitelist                              If an available update does not match one of the entries, then it is skipped and not installed.
   list                                   Each entry can either be the KB article or Update title as a regex according to the PowerShell regex rules.
   added in 2.5                           The whitelist is only validated on updates that were found based on category_names. It will not force the module to install an update if it was not in the
                                          category specified.

NOTES                   *win_updates-notes*

   Note

     • win_updates must be run by a user with membership in the local Administrators group.
     • win_updates will use the default update service configured for the machine (Windows Update, Microsoft Update, WSUS, etc).
     • win_updates will become SYSTEM using runas unless use_scheduled_task is yes
     • By default win_updates does not manage reboots, but will signal when a reboot is required with the reboot_required return value, as of Ansible v2.5 reboot can be used to reboot the host if
       required in the one task.
     • win_updates can take a significant amount of time to complete (hours, in some cases). Performance depends on many factors, including OS version, number of updates, system load, and update
       server load.
     • Beware that just after win_updates reboots the system, the Windows system may not have settled yet and some base services could be in limbo. This can result in unexpected behavior. Check the
       examples for ways to mitigate this.
