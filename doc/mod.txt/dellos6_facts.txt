SYNOPSIS                   *dellos6_facts*

     • Collects a base set of device facts from a remote device that is running OS6. This module prepends all of the base network fact keys with ansible_net_<fact>. The facts module will always
       collect a base set of facts from the device and can enable or disable collection of additional facts.

PARAMETERS                   *dellos6_facts-parameters*

     Parameter   Choices/Defaults                                                                              Comments
   gather_subset Default:         When supplied, this argument will restrict the facts collected to a given subset. Possible values for this argument include all, hardware, config, and interfaces.
   -             ["!config"]      Can specify a list of values to include a larger subset. Values can also be used with an initial ! to specify that a specific subset should not be collected.
   provider                       A dict object containing connection details.
   dictionary
     host                         Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport. The value of host is used as the destination address for
     string /                     the transport.
     required
     password                     Password to authenticate the SSH session to the remote device. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD
     string                       will be used instead.
     port        Default:         Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device.
     integer     22
     ssh_keyfile                  Path to an ssh key used to authenticate the SSH session to the remote device. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable
     path                         ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE will be used instead.
     timeout     Default:         Specifies idle timeout (in seconds) for the connection. Useful if the console freezes before continuing. For example when saving configurations.
     integer     10
     username                     User to authenticate the SSH session to the remote device. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will
     string                       be used instead.
