NOTES                   *cobbler_sync-notes*

   Note

     • Concurrently syncing Cobbler is bound to fail with weird errors.
     • On python 2.7.8 and older (i.e. on RHEL7) you may need to tweak the python behaviour to disable certificate validation. More information at Certificate verification in Python standard
       library HTTP clients.
