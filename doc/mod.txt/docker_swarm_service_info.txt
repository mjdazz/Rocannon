SYNOPSIS                   *docker_swarm_service_info*

     • Retrieves information about a docker service.
     • Essentially returns the output of docker service inspect <name>.
     • Must be executed on a host running as Swarm Manager, otherwise the module will fail.

REQUIREMENTS                   *docker_swarm_service_info-requirements*

   The below requirements are needed on the host that executes this module.

     • Docker API >= 1.24
     • Docker SDK for Python: Please note that the docker-py Python module has been superseded by docker (see here for details). For Python 2.6, docker-py must be used. Otherwise, it is recommended
       to install the docker Python module. Note that both modules should not be installed at the same time. Also note that when both modules are installed and one of them is uninstalled, the other
       might no longer function and a reinstall of it is required.
     • Docker SDK for Python >= 2.0.0

   debug            Choices:

                                               The URL or Unix socket path used to connect to the Docker API. To connect to a remote host, provide the TCP connection string. For example,
   docker_host    Default:                     tcp://192.0.2.23:2376. If TLS is used to encrypt the connection, the module will automatically replace tcp in the connection URL with https.
   string         "unix://var/run/docker.sock" If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable DOCKER_HOST will be used instead. If the environment variable is not set,
                                               the default value will be used.

   string                                      If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable DOCKER_SSL_VERSION will be used instead.
   timeout        Default:                     The maximum amount of time in seconds to wait on a response from the API.
   integer        60                           If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable DOCKER_TIMEOUT will be used instead. If the environment variable is not
                                               set, the default value will be used.
                    Choices:                   Secure the connection to the API by using TLS without verifying the authenticity of the Docker host server. Note that if validate_certs is set to yes
   tls              • no ←                     as well, it will take precedence.
   boolean          • yes                      If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable DOCKER_TLS will be used instead. If the environment variable is not set,
                                               the default value will be used.
   tls_hostname   Default:                     When verifying the authenticity of the Docker Host server, provide the expected name of the server.
   string         "localhost"                  If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable DOCKER_TLS_HOSTNAME will be used instead. If the environment variable is
                                               not set, the default value will be used.
                    Choices:                   Secure the connection to the API by using TLS and verifying the authenticity of the Docker host server.
   validate_certs   • no ←                     If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY will be used instead. If the environment variable is
   boolean          • yes                      not set, the default value will be used.

NOTES                   *docker_swarm_service_info-notes*

   Note

     • Connect to the Docker daemon by providing parameters with each task or by defining environment variables. You can define DOCKER_HOST, DOCKER_TLS_HOSTNAME, DOCKER_API_VERSION,
       DOCKER_CERT_PATH, DOCKER_SSL_VERSION, DOCKER_TLS, DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY and DOCKER_TIMEOUT. If you are using docker machine, run the script shipped with the product that sets up the environment.
       It will set these variables for you. See https://docs.docker.com/machine/reference/env/ for more details.
     • When connecting to Docker daemon with TLS, you might need to install additional Python packages. For the Docker SDK for Python, version 2.4 or newer, this can be done by installing
       docker[tls] with pip.
     • Note that the Docker SDK for Python only allows to specify the path to the Docker configuration for very few functions. In general, it will use $HOME/.docker/config.json if the DOCKER_CONFIG
       environment variable is not specified, and use $DOCKER_CONFIG/config.json otherwise.

   boolean    always   Sample:
                       True
