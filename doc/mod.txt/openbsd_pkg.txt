PARAMETERS                   *openbsd_pkg-parameters*

   Parameter Choices/Defaults                                                                                Comments

   name
   - /                        A name or a list of names of the packages.
   required
   ports_dir Default:         When used in combination with the build option, allows overriding the default ports source directory.
   -         "/usr/ports"
   quick       Choices:
   boolean     • no ←         Replace or delete packages quickly; do not bother with checksums before removing normal files.
               • yes
               Choices:
   state       • absent       present will make sure the package is installed. latest will make sure the latest version of the package is installed. absent will make sure the specified package is
   -           • latest       not installed.
               • present ←

NOTES                   *openbsd_pkg-notes*

   Note

     • When used with a loop: each package will be processed individually, it is much more efficient to pass the list directly to the name option.
