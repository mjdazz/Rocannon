SYNOPSIS                   *win_dns_client*

     • The win_dns_client module configures the DNS client on Windows network adapters.

PARAMETERS                   *win_dns_client-parameters*

     Parameter    Choices/Defaults                                                                              Comments
   adapter_names                   Adapter name or list of adapter names for which to manage DNS settings ('"' is supported as a wildcard value).
   string /                        The adapter name used is the connection caption in the Network Control Panel or via Get-NetAdapter, eg Local Area Connection.
   required
   ipv4_addresses                  Single or ordered list of DNS server IPv4 addresses to configure for lookup. An empty list will configure the adapter to use the DHCP-assigned values on
   string /                        connections where DHCP is enabled, or disable DNS lookup on statically-configured connections.
   required

NOTES                   *win_dns_client-notes*

   Note

     • When setting an empty list of DNS server addresses on an adapter with DHCP enabled, a change will always be registered, since it is not possible to detect the difference between a
       DHCP-sourced server value and one that is statically set.

EXAMPLES                   *win_dns_client-examples*

 - name: Set a single address on the adapter named Ethernet
   win_dns_client:
     adapter_names: Ethernet
     ipv4_addresses: 192.168.34.5

 - name: Set multiple lookup addresses on all visible adapters (usually physical adapters that are in the Up state), with debug logging to a file
   win_dns_client:
     adapter_names: '"'
     ipv4_addresses:
     - 192.168.34.5
     - 192.168.34.6
     log_path: C:\dns_log.txt

 - name: Configure all adapters whose names begin with Ethernet to use DHCP-assigned DNS values
   win_dns_client:
     adapter_names: 'Ethernet"'
     ipv4_addresses: []
