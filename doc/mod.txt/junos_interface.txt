    host                         Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport. The value of host is used as the destination address for
    string /                     the transport.
    required
    password                     Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not specified
    string                       in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD will be used instead.
    port        Default:         Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device. The port value will default to the well known SSH port of 22 (for transport=cli) or
    integer     22               port 830 (for transport=netconf) device.
    ssh_keyfile                  Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is the path to the key used to authenticate the SSH session. If the

    timeout     Default:         Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before the
    integer     10               operation is completed, the module will error.
    username                     Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not

NOTES                   *junos_interface-notes*

   Note

     • This module requires the netconf system service be enabled on the remote device being managed.
     • Tested against vSRX JUNOS version 15.1X49-D15.4, vqfx-10000 JUNOS Version 15.1X53-D60.4.
     • Recommended connection is netconf. See the Junos OS Platform Options.
     • This module also works with local connections for legacy playbooks.
     • For information on using CLI and netconf see the Junos OS Platform Options guide
