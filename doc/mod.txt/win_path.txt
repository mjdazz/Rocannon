SYNOPSIS                   *win_path*

     • Allows element-based ordering, addition, and removal of Windows path environment variables.

PARAMETERS                   *win_path-parameters*

   Parameter Choices/Defaults                                                                                Comments
                              A single path element, or a list of path elements (ie, directories) to add or remove.
                              When multiple elements are included in the list (and state is present), the elements are guaranteed to appear in the same relative order in the resultant path value.
   elements                   Variable expansions (eg, %VARNAME%) are allowed, and are stored unexpanded in the target path element.
   list /                     Any existing path elements not mentioned in elements are always preserved in their current order.
   required                   New path elements are appended to the path, and existing path elements may be moved closer to the end to satisfy the requested ordering.
                              Paths are compared in a case-insensitive fashion, and trailing backslashes are ignored for comparison purposes. However, note that trailing backslashes in YAML require
                              quotes.
   name      Default:         Target path environment variable name.
   string    "PATH"
   scope       Choices:
   string      • machine ←    The level at which the environment variable specified by name should be managed (either for the current user or global machine scope).
               • user
   state       Choices:
   string      • absent       Whether the path elements specified in elements should be present or absent.
               • present

NOTES                   *win_path-notes*

   Note

     • This module is for modifying individual elements of path-like environment variables. For general-purpose management of other environment vars, use the win_environment module.
     • This module does not broadcast change events. This means that the minority of windows applications which can have their environment changed without restarting will not be notified and
       therefore will need restarting to pick up new environment settings.
     • User level environment variables will require an interactive user to log out and in again before they become available.

EXAMPLES                   *win_path-examples*

 - name: Ensure that system32 and Powershell are present on the global system path, and in the specified order
   win_path:
     elements:
     - '%SystemRoot%\system32'
     - '%SystemRoot%\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0'

 - name: Ensure that C:\Program Files\MyJavaThing is not on the current user's CLASSPATH
   win_path:
     name: CLASSPATH
     elements: C:\Program Files\MyJavaThing
     scope: user
     state: absent
