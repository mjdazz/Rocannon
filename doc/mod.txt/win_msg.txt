NOTES                   *win_msg-notes*

   Note

     • This module must run on a windows host, so ensure your play targets windows hosts, or delegates to a windows host.
     • Messages are only sent to the local host where the module is run.
     • The module does not support sending to users listed in a file.
     • Setting wait to yes can result in long run times on systems with many logged in users.
