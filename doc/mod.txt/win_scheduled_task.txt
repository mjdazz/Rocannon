NOTES                   *win_scheduled_task-notes*

   Note

     • In Ansible 2.4 and earlier, this could only be run on Server 2012/Windows 8 or newer. Since Ansible 2.5 this restriction has been lifted.
     • The option names and structure for actions and triggers of a service follow the RegisteredTask naming standard and requirements, it would be useful to read up on this guide if coming across
       any issues https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa382542.aspx.
     • A Group Managed Service Account (gMSA) can be used by setting logon_type to password and omitting the password parameter. For more information on gMSAs, see
