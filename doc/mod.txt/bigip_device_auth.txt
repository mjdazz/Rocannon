SYNOPSIS                   *bigip_device_auth*

     • Manage the system authentication configuration. This module can assist in configuring a number of different system authentication types. Note that this module can not be used to configure
       APM authentication types.

NOTES                   *bigip_device_auth-notes*

   Note

     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
