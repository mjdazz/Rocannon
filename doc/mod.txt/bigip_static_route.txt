   string
   destination                      Specifies an IP address for the static entry in the routing table. When creating a new static route, this value is required.

   string                           either an IPv4 or IPv6 address. When it is an IPv6 address that starts with FE80:, the address will be treated as a link-local address. This requires that the

NOTES                   *bigip_static_route-notes*

   Note

     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
