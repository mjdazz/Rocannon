PARAMETERS                   *svc-parameters*

    Parameter  Choices/Defaults                                                                               Comments
   downed        Choices:
   boolean       • no ←         Should a 'down' file exist or not, if it exists it disables auto startup. Defaults to no. Downed does not imply stopped.
                 • yes
   enabled       Choices:
   boolean       • no           Whether the service is enabled or not, if disabled it also implies stopped. Take note that a service can be enabled and downed (no auto restart).
                 • yes
   name
   string /                     Name of the service to manage.
   required
   service_dir Default:         Directory svscan watches for services
   string      "/service"
   service_src Default:         Directory where services are defined, the source of symlinks to service_dir.
   string      "/etc/service"
                 Choices:
                 • killed
   state         • once         Started/stopped are idempotent actions that will not run commands unless necessary. restarted will always bounce the svc (svc -t) and killed will always bounce the
   string        • reloaded     svc (svc -k). reloaded will send a sigusr1 (svc -1). once will run a normally downed svc once (svc -o), not really an idempotent operation.
                 • restarted
                 • started
                 • stopped
