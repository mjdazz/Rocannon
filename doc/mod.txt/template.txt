SYNOPSIS                   *template*

     • Templates are processed by the Jinja2 templating language.
     • Documentation on the template formatting can be found in the Template Designer Documentation.
     • Additional variables listed below can be used in templates.
     • ansible_managed (configurable via the defaults section of ansible.cfg) contains a string which can be used to describe the template name, host, modification time of the template file and the
       owner uid.
     • template_host contains the node name of the template’s machine.
     • template_uid is the numeric user id of the owner.
     • template_path is the path of the template.
     • template_fullpath is the absolute path of the template.
     • template_destpath is the path of the template on the remote system (added in 2.8).
     • template_run_date is the date that the template was rendered.

PARAMETERS                   *template-parameters*

         Parameter       Choices/Defaults                                                                          Comments
                                          The attributes the resulting file or directory should have.
   attributes                             To get supported flags look at the man page for chattr on the target system.
   string                                 This string should contain the attributes in the same order as the one displayed by lsattr.
                                          The = operator is assumed as default, otherwise + or - operators need to be included in the string.
                                          aliases: attr

                           • yes
   block_end_string      Default:
   string                "%}"             The string marking the end of a block.
   added in 2.4

   added in 2.4
   dest                                   Location to render the template to on the remote machine.
   path / required
   follow                  Choices:       Determine whether symbolic links should be followed.
   boolean                 • no ←         When set to yes symbolic links will be followed, if they exist.
   added in 2.4            • yes          When set to no symbolic links will not be followed.
                                          Previous to Ansible 2.4, this was hardcoded as yes.
   force                   Choices:       Determine when the file is being transferred if the destination already exists.
   boolean                 • no           When set to yes, replace the remote file when contents are different than the source.
                           • yes ←        When set to no, the file will only be transferred if the destination does not exist.
   group                                  Name of the group that should own the file/directory, as would be fed to chown.
   string
   lstrip_blocks           Choices:       Determine when leading spaces and tabs should be stripped.
   boolean                 • no ←         When set to yes leading spaces and tabs are stripped from the start of a line to a block.
   added in 2.6            • yes          This functionality requires Jinja 2.7 or newer.
                                          The permissions the resulting file or directory should have.
                                          For those used to /usr/bin/chmod remember that modes are actually octal numbers. You must either add a leading zero so that Ansible's YAML parser knows it
                                          is an octal number (like 0644 or 01777) or quote it (like '644' or '1777') so Ansible receives a string and can do its own conversion from string into
   mode                                   number.
   string                                 Giving Ansible a number without following one of these rules will end up with a decimal number which will have unexpected results.
                                          As of Ansible 1.8, the mode may be specified as a symbolic mode (for example, u+rwx or u=rw,g=r,o=r).
                                          As of Ansible 2.6, the mode may also be the special string preserve.
                                          When set to preserve the file will be given the same permissions as the source file.
   newline_sequence        Choices:
   string                  • \n ←         Specify the newline sequence to use for templating files.
   added in 2.4            • \r
                           • \r\n
   output_encoding       Default:         Overrides the encoding used to write the template file defined by dest.
   string                "utf-8"          It defaults to utf-8, but any encoding supported by python can be used.
   added in 2.7                           The source template file must always be encoded using utf-8, for homogeneity.
   owner                                  Name of the user that should own the file/directory, as would be fed to chown.
   string
   selevel               Default:         The level part of the SELinux file context.
   string                "s0"             This is the MLS/MCS attribute, sometimes known as the range.
                                          When set to _default, it will use the level portion of the policy if available.
   serole                                 The role part of the SELinux file context.
   string                                 When set to _default, it will use the role portion of the policy if available.
   setype                                 The type part of the SELinux file context.
   string                                 When set to _default, it will use the type portion of the policy if available.
   seuser                                 The user part of the SELinux file context.
   string                                 By default it uses the system policy, where applicable.
                                          When set to _default, it will use the user portion of the policy if available.
   src                                    Path of a Jinja2 formatted template on the Ansible controller.
   path / required                        This can be a relative or an absolute path.
                                          The file must be encoded with utf-8 but output_encoding can be used to control the encoding of the output template.
   trim_blocks             Choices:       Determine when newlines should be removed from blocks.
   boolean                 • no           When set to yes the first newline after a block is removed (block, not variable tag!).
   added in 2.4            • yes ←
                                          Influence when to use atomic operation to prevent data corruption or inconsistent reads from the target file.
                                          By default this module uses atomic operations to prevent data corruption or inconsistent reads from the target files, but sometimes systems are configured
   unsafe_writes           Choices:       or just broken in ways that prevent this. One example is docker mounted files, which cannot be updated atomically from inside the container and can only be
   boolean                 • no ←         written in an unsafe manner.
                           • yes          This option allows Ansible to fall back to unsafe methods of updating files when atomic operations fail (however, it doesn't force Ansible to perform
                                          unsafe writes).
                                          IMPORTANT! Unsafe writes are subject to race conditions and can lead to data corruption.
   validate                               The validation command to run before copying into place.
   string                                 The path to the file to validate is passed in via '%s' which must be present as in the examples below.
                                          The command is passed securely so shell features like expansion and pipes will not work.
   variable_end_string   Default:
   string                "}}"             The string marking the end of a print statement.
   added in 2.4
   variable_start_string Default:
   string                "{{"             The string marking the beginning of a print statement.
   added in 2.4

NOTES                   *template-notes*

   Note

     • You can use the copy module with the content: option if you prefer the template inline, as part of the playbook.
     • For Windows you can use win_template which uses ‘\r\n’ as newline_sequence by default.
     • Including a string that uses a date in the template will result in the template being marked ‘changed’ each time.
     • Since Ansible 0.9, templates are loaded with trim_blocks=True.
     • Also, you can override jinja2 settings by adding a special header to template file. i.e. #jinja2:variable_start_string:'[%', variable_end_string:'%]', trim_blocks: False which changes the
       variable interpolation markers to [% var %] instead of {{ var }}. This is the best way to prevent evaluation of things that look like, but should not be Jinja2.
     • Using raw/endraw in Jinja2 will not work as you expect because templates in Ansible are recursively evaluated.
     • To find Byte Order Marks in files, use Format-Hex <file> -Count 16 on Windows, and use od -a -t x1 -N 16 <file> on Linux.
