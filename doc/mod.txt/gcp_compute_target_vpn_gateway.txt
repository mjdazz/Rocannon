   Note

     • API Reference: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/targetVpnGateways
     • for authentication, you can set service_account_file using the c(gcp_service_account_file) env variable.
     • for authentication, you can set service_account_contents using the c(GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CONTENTS) env variable.
     • For authentication, you can set service_account_email using the GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL env variable.
     • For authentication, you can set auth_kind using the GCP_AUTH_KIND env variable.
     • For authentication, you can set scopes using the GCP_SCOPES env variable.
     • Environment variables values will only be used if the playbook values are not set.
