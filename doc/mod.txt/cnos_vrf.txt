   associated_interfaces                  This is a intent option and checks the operational state of the for given vrf name for associated interfaces. If the value in the associated_interfaces
   -                                      does not match with the operational state of vrf interfaces on device it will result in failure.
   delay                 Default:         Time in seconds to wait before checking for the operational state on remote device. This wait is applicable for operational state arguments.
