   entry_timeout                              When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent profile.
   string                                     To specify an indefinite timeout, use the value indefinite.
                                              If specifying a numeric timeout, the value must be between 1 and 4294967295.
                               Choices:       Specifies the algorithm the system uses for hash persistence load balancing. The hash result is the input for the algorithm.
   hash_algorithm              • default      When default, specifies that the system uses the index of pool members to obtain the hash result for the input to the algorithm.
   string                      • carp         When carp, specifies that the system uses the Cache Array Routing Protocol (CARP) to obtain the hash result for the input to the algorithm.

   match_across_services       Choices:       When yes, specifies that all persistent connections from a client IP address that go to the same virtual IP address also go to the same node.
   boolean                     • no           When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent profile.

   match_across_virtuals       Choices:       When yes, specifies that all persistent connections from the same client IP address go to the same node.
   boolean                     • no           When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent profile.
                               • yes
   name                                       Specifies the name of the profile.

                               • yes
   parent                                     Specifies the profile from which this profile inherits settings.
   string                                     When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is the system-supplied source_addr profile.

NOTES                   *bigip_profile_persistence_src_addr-notes*

   Note

     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
