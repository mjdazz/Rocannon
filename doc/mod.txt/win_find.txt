SYNOPSIS                   *win_find*

     • Return a list of files based on specified criteria.
     • Multiple criteria are AND’d together.
     • For non-Windows targets, use the find module instead.

PARAMETERS                   *win_find-parameters*

       Parameter      Choices/Defaults                                                                            Comments
   age                                 Select files or folders whose age is equal to or greater than the specified time.
   string                              Use a negative age to find files equal to or less than the specified time.
                                       You can choose seconds, minutes, hours, days or weeks by specifying the first letter of an of those words (e.g., "2s", "10d", 1w").
                        Choices:
   age_stamp            • atime        Choose the file property against which we compare age.
   string               • ctime        The default attribute we compare with is the last modification time.
                        • mtime ←
                        Choices:
                        • md5
   checksum_algorithm   • sha1 ←       Algorithm to determine the checksum of a file.
   string               • sha256       Will throw an error if the host is unable to use specified algorithm.
                        • sha384
                        • sha512
   file_type            Choices:
   string               • directory    Type of file to search for.
                        • file ←
   follow               Choices:       Set this to yes to follow symlinks in the path.
   boolean              • no ←         This needs to be used in conjunction with recurse.
                        • yes
   get_checksum         Choices:
   boolean              • no           Whether to return a checksum of the file in the return info (default sha1), use checksum_algorithm to change from the default.
                        • yes ←
   hidden               Choices:
   boolean              • no ←         Set this to include hidden files or folders.
                        • yes
   paths                               List of paths of directories to search for files or folders in.
   list / required                     This can be supplied as a single path or a list of paths.
                                       One or more (powershell or regex) patterns to compare filenames with.
   patterns                            The type of pattern matching is controlled by use_regex option.
   list                                The patterns restrict the list of files or folders to be returned based on the filenames.
                                       For a file to be matched it only has to match with one pattern in a list provided.
                                       aliases: regex, regexp
   recurse              Choices:
   boolean              • no ←         Will recursively descend into the directory looking for files or folders.
                        • yes
                                       Select files or folders whose size is equal to or greater than the specified size.
   size                                Use a negative value to find files equal to or less than the specified size.
   string                              You can specify the size with a suffix of the byte type i.e. kilo = k, mega = m...
                                       Size is not evaluated for symbolic links.
   use_regex            Choices:
   boolean              • no ←         Will set patterns to run as a regex check if set to yes.
                        • yes
