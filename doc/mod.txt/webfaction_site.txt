NOTES                   *webfaction_site-notes*

   Note

     • Sadly, you do need to know your webfaction hostname for the host parameter. But at least, unlike the API, you don’t need to know the IP address. You can use a DNS name.
     • If a site of the same name exists in the account but on a different host, the operation will exit.
     • You can run playbooks that use this on a local machine, or on a Webfaction host, or elsewhere, since the scripts use the remote webfaction API. The location is not important. However,
       running them on multiple hosts simultaneously is best avoided. If you don’t specify localhost as your host, you may want to add serial: 1 to the plays.
     • See the webfaction API for more info.
