SYNOPSIS                   *bigip_config*

     • Manages a BIG-IP configuration by allowing TMSH commands that modify running configuration, or merge SCF formatted files into the running configuration. Additionally, this module is of
       significant importance because it allows you to save your running configuration to disk. Since the F5 module only manipulate running configuration, it is important that you utilize this
       module to save that running config.

PARAMETERS                   *bigip_config-parameters*

      Parameter    Choices/Defaults                                                                             Comments
   merge_content                    Loads the specified configuration that you want to merge into the running configuration. This is equivalent to using the tmsh command load sys config
   string                           from-terminal merge.
                                    If you need to read configuration from a file or template, use Ansible's file or template lookup plugins respectively.

NOTES                   *bigip_config-notes*

   Note

     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
