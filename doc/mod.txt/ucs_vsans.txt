       Parameter     Choices/Defaults                                                                            Comments
                       Choices:       The fabric configuration of the VSAN. This can be one of the following:
   fabric              • common ←     common - The VSAN maps to the same VSAN ID in all available fabrics.
   -                   • A            A - The VSAN maps to the a VSAN ID that exists only in fabric A.
                       • B            B - The VSAN maps to the a VSAN ID that exists only in fabric B.
                                      Fibre Channel zoning configuration for the Cisco UCS domain.
   fc_zoning           Choices:       Fibre Channel zoning can be set to one of the following values:
   -                   • disabled ←   disabled — The upstream switch handles Fibre Channel zoning, or Fibre Channel zoning is not implemented for the Cisco UCS domain.
                       • enabled      enabled — Cisco UCS Manager configures and controls Fibre Channel zoning for the Cisco UCS domain.
                                      If you enable Fibre Channel zoning, do not configure the upstream switch with any VSANs that are being used for Fibre Channel zoning.
   hostname                           IP address or hostname of Cisco UCS Manager.
   string / required
                                      The name assigned to the VSAN.
   name                               This name can be between 1 and 32 alphanumeric characters.

   string / required
   port                               Port number to be used during connection (by default uses 443 for https and 80 for http connection).

   string
   state               Choices:       If present, will verify VSANs are present and will create if needed.
   -                   • present ←    If absent, will verify VSANs are absent and will delete if needed.

   string            "admin"
   vlan_id                            The unique string identifier assigned to the VLAN used for Fibre Channel connections.
   - / required                       Note that Cisco UCS Manager uses VLAN '4048'. See the UCS Manager configuration guide if you want to assign '4048' to a VLAN.
