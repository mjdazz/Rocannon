SYNOPSIS                   *bigip_vcmp_guest*

     • Manages vCMP guests on a BIG-IP. This functionality only exists on actual hardware and must be enabled by provisioning vcmp with the bigip_provision module.

PARAMETERS                   *bigip_vcmp_guest-parameters*

        Parameter      Choices/Defaults                                                                           Comments
                                        Contains those slots that the guest is allowed to be assigned to.
   allowed_slots                        When the host determines which slots this guest should be assigned to, only slots in this list will be considered.
   list                                 This is a good way to force guests to be assigned only to particular slots, or, by configuring disjoint allowed_slots on two guests, that those guests are
   added in 2.7                         never assigned to the same slot.
                                        By default this list includes every available slot in the cluster. This means, by default, the guest may be assigned to any slot.
                                        Specifies the number of cores that the system allocates to the guest.
   cores_per_slot                       Each core represents a portion of CPU and memory. Therefore, the amount of memory allocated per core is directly tied to the amount of CPU. This amount of
   integer                              memory varies per hardware platform type.
                                        The number you can specify depends on the type of hardware you have.
                                        In the event of a reboot, the system persists the guest to the same slot on which it ran prior to the reboot.
   delete_virtual_disk   Choices:
   boolean               • no ←         When state is absent, will additionally delete the virtual disk associated with the vCMP guest. By default, this value is no.
                         • yes
   initial_hotfix
   string                               Specifies the hotfix ISO image file which will be applied on top of the base image.
   added in 2.9
   initial_image                        Specifies the base software release ISO image file for installing the TMOS hypervisor instance and any licensed BIG-IP modules onto the guest's virtual disk.
   string                               When creating a new guest, this parameter is required.
   mgmt_address                         Specifies the IP address, and subnet or subnet mask that you use to access the guest when you want to manage a module running within the guest. This
   string                               parameter is required if the mgmt_network parameter is bridged.
                                        When creating a new guest, if you do not specify a network or network mask, a default of /24 (255.255.255.0) will be assumed.
                                        Specifies the method by which the management address is used in the vCMP guest.
                                        When bridged, specifies that the guest can communicate with the vCMP host's management network.
                                        When isolated, specifies that the guest is isolated from the vCMP host's management network. In this case, the only way that a guest can communicate with the
                         Choices:       vCMP host is through the console port or through a self IP address on the guest that allows traffic through port 22.
   mgmt_network          • bridged      When host only, prevents the guest from installing images and hotfixes other than those provided by the hypervisor.
   string                • isolated     If the guest setting is isolated or host only, the mgmt_address does not apply.
                         • host only    Concerning mode changing, changing bridged to isolated causes the vCMP host to remove all of the guest's management interfaces from its bridged management
                                        network. This immediately disconnects the guest's VMs from the physical management network. Changing isolated to bridged causes the vCMP host to dynamically
                                        add the guest's management interfaces to the bridged management network. This immediately connects all of the guest's VMs to the physical management network.
                                        Changing this property while the guest is in the configured or provisioned state has no immediate effect.
   mgmt_route                           Specifies the gateway address for the mgmt_address.
   string                               If this value is not specified when creating a new guest, it is set to none.
                                        The value none can be used during an update to remove this value.
                                        Specifies the minimum number of slots that the guest must be assigned to in order to deploy.
   min_number_of_slots                  This field dictates the number of slots that the guest must be assigned to.
   integer                              If at the end of any allocation attempt the guest is not assigned to at least this many slots, the attempt fails and the change that initiated it is
   added in 2.7                         reverted.
                                        A guest's min_number_of_slots value cannot be greater than its number_of_slots.
   name                                 The name of the vCMP guest to manage.
   string / required
   number_of_slots                      Specifies the number of slots for the system to use for creating the guest.
   integer                              This value dictates how many cores a guest is allocated from each slot that it is assigned to.
   added in 2.7                         Possible values are dependent on the type of blades being used in this cluster.
                                        The default value depends on the type of blades being used in this cluster.

     integer           443              You may omit this option by setting the environment variable F5_SERVER_PORT.
     ssh_keyfile                        Specifies the SSH keyfile to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This argument is only used for cli transports.
     path                               You may omit this option by setting the environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE.
     timeout                            Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before the
     integer                            operation is completed, the module will error.
     transport           Choices:
     string              • cli          Configures the transport connection to use when connecting to the remote device.

                         Choices:       The state of the vCMP guest on the system. Each state implies the actions of all states before it.
                         • configured   When configured, guarantees that the vCMP guest exists with the provided attributes. Additionally, ensures that the vCMP guest is turned off.
   state                 • disabled     When disabled, behaves the same as configured the name of this state is just a convenience for the user that is more understandable.
   string                • provisioned  When provisioned, will ensure that the guest is created and installed. This state will not start the guest; use deployed for that. This state is one step
                         • present ←    beyond present as present will not install the guest; only setup the configuration for it to be installed.
                         • absent       When present, ensures the guest is properly provisioned and starts the guest so that it is in a running state.
                                        When absent, removes the vCMP from the system.
                                        VLANs that the guest uses to communicate with other guests, the host, and with the external network. The available VLANs in the list are those that are
   vlans                                currently configured on the vCMP host.
   list                                 The order of these VLANs is not important; in fact, it's ignored. This module will order the VLANs for you automatically. Therefore, if you deliberately
                                        re-order them in subsequent tasks, you will find that this module will not register a change.

NOTES                   *bigip_vcmp_guest-notes*

   Note

     • This module can take a lot of time to deploy vCMP guests. This is an intrinsic limitation of the vCMP system because it is booting real VMs on the BIG-IP device. This boot time is very
       similar in length to the time it takes to boot VMs on any other virtualization platform; public or private.
     • When BIG-IP starts, the VMs are booted sequentially; not in parallel. This means that it is not unusual for a vCMP host with many guests to take a long time (60+ minutes) to reboot and bring
       all the guests online. The BIG-IP chassis will be available before all vCMP guests are online.
     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
