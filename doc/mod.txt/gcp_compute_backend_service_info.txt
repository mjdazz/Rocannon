   complex
     affinityCookieTtlSec                 Lifetime of cookies in seconds if session_affinity is GENERATED_COOKIE. If set to 0, the cookie is non-persistent and lasts only until the end of the
     integer                     success  browser session (or equivalent). The maximum allowed value for TTL is one day.
                                          When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, this field is not used.

       string                    success  Default value is 1, which means the group will serve up to 100% of its configured capacity (depending on balancingMode). A setting of 0 means the group is
                                          completely drained, offering 0% of its available Capacity. Valid range is [0.0,1.0].

       integer                   success  Can be used with either RATE or UTILIZATION balancing modes, but required if RATE mode. For RATE mode, either maxRate or one of maxRatePerInstance or
                                          maxRatePerEndpoint, as appropriate for group type, must be set.
       maxRatePerEndpoint        success  The max requests per second (RPS) that a single backend network endpoint can handle. This is used to calculate the capacity of the group. Can be used in
