   always_send                 Choices:
   boolean                     • no           Send the cookie persistence entry on every reply, even if the entry has previously been supplied to the client.
                               • yes
                               Choices:       Specifies the way in which the cookie encryption format is used.
   cookie_encryption           • disabled     When disabled, generates the cookie format unencrypted.
   string                      • preferred    When preferred, generate an encrypted cookie, but accepts both encrypted and unencrypted formats.
                               • required     When required, cookie format must be encrypted.
                                              Specifies the type of cookie processing that the system uses.
                               Choices:       When hash, specifies that the server provides the cookie, which the system then maps consistently to a specific node. This persistence type requires a
   cookie_method               • hash         cookie_name value.
   string                      • insert       When insert, specifies that the system inserts server information, in the form of a cookie, into the header of the server response.
                               • passive      When passive, specifies that the server provides the cookie, formatted with the correct server information and timeout. This persistence type requires
                               • rewrite      a cookie_name value.
                                              When rewrite, specifies that the system intercepts the BIGipCookie header, sent from the server, and overwrites the name and value of that cookie.
   cookie_name                                Specifies a unique name for the cookie.
   string
   description                                Description of the profile.

   string
   expiration                                 Specifies the expiration time of the cookie. By default the system generates and uses session cookie. This cookie expires when the user session
   dictionary                                 expires, that is when the browser is closed.

NOTES                   *bigip_profile_persistence_cookie-notes*

   Note

     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
