PARAMETERS                   *netapp_e_iscsi_interface-parameters*

     Parameter    Choices/Defaults                                                                              Comments
   address                         The IPv4 address to assign to the interface.
   -                               Should be specified in xx.xx.xx.xx form.
                                   Mutually exclusive with config_method=dhcp
   api_password
   string /                        The password to authenticate with the SANtricity Web Services Proxy or Embedded Web Services API.
   required
   api_url
   string /                        The url to the SANtricity Web Services Proxy or Embedded Web Services API. Example https://prod-1.wahoo.acme.com/devmgr/v2
   required
   api_username
   string /                        The username to authenticate with the SANtricity Web Services Proxy or Embedded Web Services API.
   required
   config_method    Choices:       The configuration method type to use for this interface.
   -                • dhcp ←       dhcp is mutually exclusive with address, subnet_mask, and gateway.
                    • static
   controller       Choices:       The controller that owns the port you want to configure.
   - / required     • A            Controller names are presented alphabetically, with the first controller as A, the second as B, and so on.
                    • B            Current hardware models have either 1 or 2 available controllers, but that is not a guaranteed hard limitation and could change in the future.
   gateway                         The IPv4 gateway address to utilize for the interface.
   -                               Should be specified in xx.xx.xx.xx form.
                                   Mutually exclusive with config_method=dhcp
   log_path                        A local path to a file to be used for debug logging
   -
                                   The maximum transmission units (MTU), in bytes.
   mtu            Default:         This allows you to configure a larger value for the MTU, in order to enable jumbo frames (any value > 1500).
   -              1500             Generally, it is necessary to have your host, switches, and other components not only support jumbo frames, but also have it configured properly. Therefore,
                                   unless you know what you're doing, it's best to leave this at the default.
                                   aliases: max_frame_size
                                   The channel of the port to modify the configuration of.
   name                            The list of choices is not necessarily comprehensive. It depends on the number of ports that are available in the system.
   - / required                    The numerical value represents the number of the channel (typically from left to right on the HIC), beginning with a value of 1.
                                   aliases: channel
   ssid           Default:         The ID of the array to manage. This value must be unique for each array.
   string         1
   state            Choices:       When enabled, the provided configuration will be utilized.
   -                • enabled ←    When disabled, the IPv4 configuration will be cleared and IPv4 connectivity disabled.
                    • disabled
   subnet_mask                     The subnet mask to utilize for the interface.
   -                               Should be specified in xx.xx.xx.xx form.
                                   Mutually exclusive with config_method=dhcp
   validate_certs   Choices:
   boolean          • no           Should https certificates be validated?
                    • yes ←

NOTES                   *netapp_e_iscsi_interface-notes*

   Note

     • Check mode is supported.
     • The interface settings are applied synchronously, but changes to the interface itself (receiving a new IP address via dhcp, etc), can take seconds or minutes longer to take effect.
     • This module will not be useful/usable on an E-Series system without any iSCSI interfaces.
     • This module requires a Web Services API version of >= 1.3.
     • The E-Series Ansible modules require either an instance of the Web Services Proxy (WSP), to be available to manage the storage-system, or an E-Series storage-system that supports the
       Embedded Web Services API.
     • Embedded Web Services is currently available on the E2800, E5700, EF570, and newer hardware models.
     • netapp_e_storage_system may be utilized for configuring the systems managed by a WSP instance.

RETURN VALUES                   *netapp_e_iscsi_interface-return values*

   Common return values are documented here, the following are the fields unique to this module:

     Key    Returned                                                                                    Description
                      Indicates whether IPv4 connectivity has been enabled or disabled.
   enabled on success This does not necessarily indicate connectivity. If dhcp was enabled without a dhcp server, for instance, it is unlikely that the configuration will actually be valid.
   boolean            Sample:
                      True
   msg                Success message
   string  on success Sample:
                      The interface settings have been updated.
