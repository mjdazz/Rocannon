PARAMETERS                   *bigip_file_copy-parameters*

      Parameter      Choices/Defaults                                                                             Comments
                                        Specifies the datastore to put the file in.
                     Choices:           There are several different datastores and each of them allows files to be exposed in different ways.
   datastore         • external-monitor When external-monitor, the specified file will be stored as an external monitor file and be available for use in external monitors
   string            • ifile ←          When ifile, the specified file will be stored as an iFile.
                     • lw4o6-table      When lw4o6-table, the specified file will be store as an Lightweight 4 over 6 (lw4o6) tunnel binding table, which include an IPv6 address for the lwB4,
                                        public IPv4 address, and restricted port set.
                     Choices:           Force overwrite a file.
   force             • no               By default, files will only be overwritten if the SHA of the file is different for the given filename. This parameter can be used to force overwrite the file
   boolean           • yes              even if it already exists and its SHA matches.
                                        The lw4o6-table datastore does not keep checksums of its file. Therefore, you would need to provide this argument to update any of these files.
   name                                 The name of the file as it should reside on the BIG-IP.
   string                               If this is not specified, then the filename provided in the source parameter is used instead.
   partition       Default:             Device partition to manage resources on.
   string          "Common"
   provider
   dictionary                           A dict object containing connection details.
   added in 2.5
    auth_provider                       Configures the auth provider for to obtain authentication tokens from the remote device.
    string                              This option is really used when working with BIG-IQ devices.
    password                            The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP.
    string /                            You may omit this option by setting the environment variable F5_PASSWORD.
    required                            aliases: pass, pwd
    server                              The BIG-IP host.
    string /                            You may omit this option by setting the environment variable F5_SERVER.
    required
    server_port    Default:             The BIG-IP server port.
    integer        443                  You may omit this option by setting the environment variable F5_SERVER_PORT.
    ssh_keyfile                         Specifies the SSH keyfile to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This argument is only used for cli transports.
    path                                You may omit this option by setting the environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE.
    timeout                             Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before the
    integer                             operation is completed, the module will error.
    transport        Choices:
    string           • cli              Configures the transport connection to use when connecting to the remote device.
                     • rest ←
    user                                The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device.

   path                                 This parameter is required if state is present.
                                        aliases: src
   state             Choices:           When present, ensures that the resource exists.
   string            • present ←        When absent, ensures the resource is removed.
                     • absent

NOTES                   *bigip_file_copy-notes*

   Note

     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
