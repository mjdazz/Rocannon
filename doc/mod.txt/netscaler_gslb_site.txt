   clip                                       Cluster IP address. Specify this parameter to connect to the remote cluster site for GSLB auto-sync. Note: The cluster IP address is defined when
   -                                          creating the cluster.
                                              Exchange metrics with other sites. Metrics are exchanged by using Metric Exchange Protocol (MEP). The appliances in the GSLB setup exchange health

   -                        • enabled         If you disable metrics exchange, you can use only static load balancing methods (such as round robin, static proximity, or the hash-based methods), and
                            • disabled        if you disable metrics exchange when a dynamic load balancing method (such as least connection) is in operation, the appliance falls back to round
                                              robin. Also, if you disable metrics exchange, you must use a monitor to determine the state of GSLB services. Otherwise, the service is marked as DOWN.
   naptrreplacementsuffix                     The naptr replacement suffix configured here will be used to construct the naptr replacement field in NAPTR record.
