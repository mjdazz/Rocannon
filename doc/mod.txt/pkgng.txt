NOTES                   *pkgng-notes*

   Note

     • When using pkgsite, be careful that already in cache packages won’t be downloaded again.
     • When used with a loop: each package will be processed individually, it is much more efficient to pass the list directly to the name option.

EXAMPLES                   *pkgng-examples*

 - name: Install package foo
   pkgng:
     name: foo
     state: present

 - name: Annotate package foo and bar

 - name: Remove packages foo and bar
   pkgng:
