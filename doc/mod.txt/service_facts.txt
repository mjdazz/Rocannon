SYNOPSIS                   *service_facts*

     • Return service state information as fact data for various service management utilities

REQUIREMENTS                   *service_facts-requirements*

   The below requirements are needed on the host that executes this module.

     • Any of the following supported init systems: systemd, sysv, upstart

NOTES                   *service_facts-notes*

   Note

     • When accessing the ansible_facts.services facts collected by this module, it is recommended to not use “dot notation” because services can have a - character in their name which would result
       in invalid “dot notation”, such as ansible_facts.services.zuul-gateway. It is instead recommended to using the string value of the service name as the key in order to obtain the fact data
       value like ansible_facts.services['zuul-gateway']

EXAMPLES                   *service_facts-examples*

 - name: Populate service facts
   service_facts:

 - debug:
     var: ansible_facts.services

RETURNED FACTS                   *service_facts-returned facts*

   Facts returned by this module are added/updated in the hostvars host facts and can be referenced by name just like any other host fact. They do not need to be registered in order to use them.
