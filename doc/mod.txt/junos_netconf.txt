SYNOPSIS                   *junos_netconf*

     • This module provides an abstraction that enables and configures the netconf system service running on Junos devices. This module can be used to easily enable the Netconf API. Netconf
       provides a programmatic interface for working with configuration and state resources as defined in RFC 6242. If the netconf_port is not mentioned in the task by default netconf will be
       enabled on port 830 only.

   netconf_port Default:         This argument specifies the port the netconf service should listen on for SSH connections. The default port as defined in RFC 6242 is 830.

                                 Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using connection: network_cli or connection: netconf.

                                 A dict object containing connection details.
    host                         Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport. The value of host is used as the destination address for
    string /                     the transport.
    required
    password                     Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not specified
    string                       in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD will be used instead.
    port        Default:         Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device. The port value will default to the well known SSH port of 22 (for transport=cli) or
    integer     22               port 830 (for transport=netconf) device.
    ssh_keyfile                  Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is the path to the key used to authenticate the SSH session. If the
    path                         value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE will be used instead.
    timeout     Default:         Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before the
    integer     10               operation is completed, the module will error.
    username                     Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not
    string                       specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will be used instead.
   state          Choices:       Specifies the state of the junos_netconf resource on the remote device. If the state argument is set to present the netconf service will be configured. If the state
   -              • present ←    argument is set to absent the netconf service will be removed from the configuration.
                  • absent

NOTES                   *junos_netconf-notes*

   Note

     • Tested against vSRX JUNOS version 15.1X49-D15.4, vqfx-10000 JUNOS Version 15.1X53-D60.4.
     • Recommended connection is network_cli. See the Junos OS Platform Options.
     • This module also works with local connections for legacy playbooks.
     • If netconf_port value is not mentioned in task by default it will be enabled on port 830 only. Although netconf_port value can be from 1 through 65535, avoid configuring access on a port
       that is normally assigned for another service. This practice avoids potential resource conflicts.
