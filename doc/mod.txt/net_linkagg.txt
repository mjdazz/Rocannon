   aggregate                  List of link aggregation definitions.
   -
   members
   - /                        List of members interfaces of the link aggregation group. The value can be single interface or list of interfaces.
   required
   min_links                  Minimum members that should be up before bringing up the link aggregation group.
   -
               Choices:
               • on
   mode        • active       Mode of the link aggregation group. A value of on will enable LACP. active configures the link to actively information about the state of the link, or it can be
   -           • passive      configured in passive mode ie. send link state information only when received them from another link.

             Default:
             "yes"
   name
   - /                        Name of the link aggregation group.
   required
   purge     Default:         Purge link aggregation groups not defined in the aggregate parameter.
   -         "no"
               Choices:
   state       • present ←
   -           • absent       State of the link aggregation group.
               • up
