SYNOPSIS                   *gather_facts*

     • This module takes care of executing the configured facts modules, the default is to use the setup module.
     • This module is automatically called by playbooks to gather useful variables about remote hosts that can be used in playbooks.
     • It can also be executed directly by /usr/bin/ansible to check what variables are available to a host.
     • Ansible provides many facts about the system, automatically.

PARAMETERS                   *gather_facts-parameters*

   Parameter Choices/Defaults                                                                                Comments

NOTES                   *gather_facts-notes*

   Note

     • This module is mostly a wrapper around other fact gathering modules.
     • Options passed to this module must be supported by all the underlying fact modules configured.
     • Facts returned by each module will be merged, conflicts will favor ‘last merged’. Order is not guaranteed, when doing parallel gathering on multiple modules.

 # Display facts from all hosts and store them indexed by I(hostname) at C(/tmp/facts).
 # ansible all -m gather_facts --tree /tmp/facts
