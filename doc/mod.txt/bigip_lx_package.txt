   path                             When state is absent, it is not necessary for the package to exist on the Ansible controller. If the full path to the package is provided, the filename will
                                    specifically be cherry picked from it to properly remove the package.

NOTES                   *bigip_lx_package-notes*

   Note

     • Requires the rpm tool be installed on the host. This can be accomplished through different ways on each platform. On Debian based systems with apt; apt-get install rpm. On Mac with brew;
       brew install rpm. This command is already present on RedHat based systems.
     • Requires BIG-IP >= 12.1.0 because the required functionality is missing on versions earlier than that.
     • The module name bigip_iapplx_package has been deprecated in favor of bigip_lx_package.
     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
