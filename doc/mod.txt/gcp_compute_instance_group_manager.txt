SYNOPSIS                   *gcp_compute_instance_group_manager*

     • Creates a managed instance group using the information that you specify in the request. After the group is created, it schedules an action to create instances in the group using the
       specified instance template. This operation is marked as DONE when the group is created even if the instances in the group have not yet been created. You must separately verify the status of
       the individual instances.
     • A managed instance group can have up to 1000 VM instances per group.

NOTES                   *gcp_compute_instance_group_manager-notes*

   Note

     • for authentication, you can set service_account_file using the c(gcp_service_account_file) env variable.
     • for authentication, you can set service_account_contents using the c(GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CONTENTS) env variable.
     • For authentication, you can set service_account_email using the GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL env variable.
     • For authentication, you can set auth_kind using the GCP_AUTH_KIND env variable.
     • For authentication, you can set scopes using the GCP_SCOPES env variable.
     • Environment variables values will only be used if the playbook values are not set.
     • The service_account_email and service_account_file options are mutually exclusive.

   targetSize               success  The target number of running instances for this managed instance group. Deleting or abandoning instances reduces this number. Resizing the group changes this
