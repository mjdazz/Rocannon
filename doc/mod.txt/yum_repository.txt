   mirrorlist                                           Specifies a URL to a file containing a list of baseurls.
   -                                                    This, the baseurl or metalink parameters are required if state is set to present.

                                                        For those used to /usr/bin/chmod remember that modes are actually octal numbers. You must either add a leading zero so that Ansible's YAML
                                                        parser knows it is an octal number (like 0644 or 01777) or quote it (like '644' or '1777') so Ansible receives a string and can do its own
   mode                                                 conversion from string into number.
   string                                               Giving Ansible a number without following one of these rules will end up with a decimal number which will have unexpected results.
                                                        As of Ansible 1.8, the mode may be specified as a symbolic mode (for example, u+rwx or u=rw,g=r,o=r).
                                                        As of Ansible 2.6, the mode may also be the special string preserve.
                                                        When set to preserve the file will be given the same permissions as the source file.
   name                                                 Unique repository ID. This option builds the section name of the repository in the repo file.

   priority                     Default:                Enforce ordered protection of repositories. The value is an integer from 1 to 99.

                                                        By default this module uses atomic operations to prevent data corruption or inconsistent reads from the target files, but sometimes systems
   unsafe_writes                  Choices:              are configured or just broken in ways that prevent this. One example is docker mounted files, which cannot be updated atomically from inside
   boolean                        • no ←                the container and can only be written in an unsafe manner.
                                  • yes                 This option allows Ansible to fall back to unsafe methods of updating files when atomic operations fail (however, it doesn't force Ansible to
                                                        perform unsafe writes).
                                                        IMPORTANT! Unsafe writes are subject to race conditions and can lead to data corruption.

NOTES                   *yum_repository-notes*

   Note

     • All comments will be removed if modifying an existing repo file.
     • Section order is preserved in an existing repo file.
     • Parameters in a section are ordered alphabetically in an existing repo file.
     • The repo file will be automatically deleted if it contains no repository.
     • When removing a repository, beware that the metadata cache may still remain on disk until you run yum clean all. Use a notification handler for this.
     • The params parameter was removed in Ansible 2.5 due to circumventing Ansible’s parameter handling
