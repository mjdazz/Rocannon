   cluster                         The name of cluster where the virtual machine is running.
   string                          This is a required parameter, if esxi_hostname is not set.
                                   esxi_hostname and cluster are mutually exclusive parameters.
   datacenter                      The datacenter name to which virtual machine belongs to.
   string
   esxi_hostname                   The ESXi hostname where the virtual machine is running.
   string                          This is a required parameter, if cluster is not set.
                                   esxi_hostname and cluster are mutually exclusive parameters.
                                   Destination folder, absolute or relative path to find an existing guest.
                                   This is a required parameter, only if multiple VMs are found with same name.
                                   The folder should include the datacenter. ESXi server's datacenter is ha-datacenter.
                                   Examples:

   local_path                      If local_path is not set, the created screenshot file will be kept in the directory of the virtual machine on ESXi host. If local_path is set to a valid path on
   path                            local machine, then the screenshot file will be downloaded from ESXi host to the local directory.
