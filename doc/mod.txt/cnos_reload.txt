   host                            This is the variable used to search the hosts file at /etc/ansible/hosts and identify the IP address of the device on which the template is going to be applied.
   string /                        Usually the Ansible keyword {{ inventory_hostname }} is specified in the playbook as an abstraction of the group of network elements that need to be configured.
