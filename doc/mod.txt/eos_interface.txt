    username                        Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate either the CLI login or the eAPI
    string                          authentication depending on which transport is used. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will be
