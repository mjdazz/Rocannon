                                     Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using connection: network_cli and become: yes with become_pass.
                                     This option is only required if you are using eAPI.

                                     Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device. If authorize is false, then this argument does nothing. If the value is
                                     not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS will be used instead.

                                     Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands. If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all
                                     commands in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE will be used instead.

    auth_pass                        Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device. If authorize is false, then this argument does nothing. If the value is
    string                           not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS will be used instead.
    authorize        Choices:        Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands. If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all
    boolean          • no ←          commands in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE will be used instead.

    host                             Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport. The value of host is used as the destination address
    string /                         for the transport.
    required
    password                         Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This is a common argument used for either cli or eapi transports. If the
    string                           value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD will be used instead.
    port           Default:          Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device. This value applies to either cli or eapi.
    integer        0                 The port value will default to the appropriate transport common port if none is provided in the task (cli=22, http=80, https=443).
    ssh_keyfile                      Specifies the SSH keyfile to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This argument is only used for cli transports. If the value is not
    path                             specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE will be used instead.
    timeout                          Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before the
    integer                          operation is completed, the module will error.
    transport        Choices:
    string /         • cli ←         Configures the transport connection to use when connecting to the remote device.

    use_ssl          Choices:
    boolean          • no            Configures the transport to use SSL if set to yes only when the transport=eapi. If the transport argument is not eapi, this value is ignored.
                     • yes ←
    username                         Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate either the CLI login or the eAPI
    string                           authentication depending on which transport is used. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will be
                                     used instead.
    validate_certs   Choices:        If no, SSL certificates will not be validated. This should only be used on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. If the transport argument
    boolean          • no            is not eapi, this value is ignored.
                     • yes ←
   size                              Size of buffer. The acceptable value is in range from 10 to 2147483647 bytes.
