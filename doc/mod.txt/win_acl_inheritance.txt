PARAMETERS                   *win_acl_inheritance-parameters*

   Parameter  Choices/Defaults                                                                                Comments
   path
   path /                      Path to be used for changing inheritance
   required
   reorganize   Choices:       For P(state) = absent, indicates if the inherited ACE's should be copied from the parent directory. This is necessary (in combination with removal) for a simple ACL
   boolean      • no ←         instead of using multiple ACE deny entries.
                • yes          For P(state) = present, indicates if the inherited ACE's should be deduplicated compared to the parent directory. This removes complexity of the ACL structure.
   state        Choices:
   string       • absent ←     Specify whether to enable present or disable absent ACL inheritance.
                • present
