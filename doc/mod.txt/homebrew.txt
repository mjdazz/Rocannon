      Parameter    Choices/Defaults                                                                             Comments
   install_options                  options flags to install a package
   -                                aliases: options
   name                             list of names of packages to install/remove
   -                                aliases: pkg, package, formula
   path            Default:         A ':' separated list of paths to search for 'brew' executable. Since a package (formula in homebrew parlance) location is prefixed relative to the actual path of
   -               "/usr/local/bin" brew command, providing an alternative brew path enables managing different set of packages in an alternative location in the system.
                     Choices:
                     • head
   state             • latest
   -                 • present ←    state of the package
                     • absent
                     • linked
                     • unlinked
   update_homebrew   Choices:       update homebrew itself first
   boolean           • no ←         aliases: update-brew
                     • yes
   upgrade_all       Choices:       upgrade all homebrew packages
   boolean           • no ←         aliases: upgrade
                     • yes

NOTES                   *homebrew-notes*

   Note

     • When used with a loop: each package will be processed individually, it is much more efficient to pass the list directly to the name option.
