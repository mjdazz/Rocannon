SYNOPSIS                   *bigip_iapp_template*

     • Manages TCL iApp templates on a BIG-IP. This module will allow you to deploy iApp templates to the BIG-IP and manage their lifecycle. The conventional way to use this module is to import new
       iApps as needed or by extracting the contents of the iApp archive that is provided at downloads.f5.com and then importing all the iApps with this module. This module can also update existing
       iApps provided that the source of the iApp changed while the name stayed the same. Note however that this module will not reconfigure any services that may have been created using the
       bigip_iapp_service module. iApps are normally not updated in production. Instead, new versions are deployed and then existing services are changed to consume that new template. As such, the
       ability to update templates in-place requires the force option to be used.

NOTES                   *bigip_iapp_template-notes*

   Note

     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
