SYNOPSIS                   *ec2_launch_template*

     • Create, modify, and delete EC2 Launch Templates, which can be used to create individual instances or with Autoscaling Groups.
     • The ec2_instance and ec2_asg modules can, instead of specifying all parameters on those tasks, be passed a Launch Template which contains settings like instance size, disk type, subnet, and
       more.

   -                                                     This is because only blank volumes can be encrypted on start, and these are not created from a snapshot. If a snapshot is the basis for the
                                                         volume, it contains data by definition and its encryption status cannot be changed using this action.
