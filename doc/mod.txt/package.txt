     • For Windows targets, use the win_package module instead.

   The below requirements are needed on the host that executes this module.

     • Whatever is required for the package plugins specific for each system.

PARAMETERS                   *package-parameters*

    Parameter   Choices/Defaults                                                                               Comments
   name                          Package name, or package specifier with version.
   - / required                  Syntax varies with package manager. For example name-1.0 or name=1.0.
                                 Package names also vary with package manager; this module will not "translate" them per distro. For example libyaml-dev, libyaml-devel.
   state                         Whether to install (present), or remove (absent) a package.
   - / required                  You can use other states like latest ONLY if they are supported by the underlying package module(s) executed.
   use          Default:         The required package manager module to use (yum, apt, etc). The default 'auto' will use existing facts or try to autodetect it.
   -            "auto"           You should only use this field if the automatic selection is not working for some reason.

NOTES                   *package-notes*

   Note

     • This module actually calls the pertinent package modules for each system (apt, yum, etc).
     • For Windows targets, use the win_package module instead.

EXAMPLES                   *package-examples*

 - name: remove the apache package
   package:
     name: "{{ apache }}"
     state: absent
