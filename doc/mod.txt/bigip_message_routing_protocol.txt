PARAMETERS                   *bigip_message_routing_protocol-parameters*

       Parameter     Choices/Defaults                                                                            Comments
   description                        The user defined description of the generic parser profile.
   string
   disable_parser      Choices:       When yes, the generic message parser will be disabled ignoring all incoming packets and not directly send message data.
   boolean             • no           This mode supports iRule script protocol implementations that will generate messages from the incoming transport stream and send outgoing messages on the
                       • yes          outgoing transport stream.
   max_egress_buffer                  Specifies the maximum size of the send buffer in bytes. If the number of bytes in the send buffer for a connection exceeds this value, the generic message
   integer                            protocol will stop receiving outgoing messages from the router until the size of the size of the buffer drops below this setting.
                                      The accepted range is between 0 and 4294967295 inclusive.
   max_msg_size                       Specifies the maximum size of a received message. If a message exceeds this size, the connection will be reset.
   integer                            The accepted range is between 0 and 4294967295 inclusive.
   msg_terminator                     The string of characters used to terminate a message. If the message-terminator is not specified, the generic message parser will not separate the input stream
   string                             into messages.
   name                               Specifies the name of the generic parser profile.
   string / required
   no_response         Choices:
   boolean             • no           When set, matching of responses to requests is disabled.
                       • yes
   parent                             The parent template of this parser profile. Once this value has been set, it cannot be changed.
   string                             When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is the system-supplied genericmsg profile.
   partition         Default:         Device partition to create route object on.
   string            "Common"
   provider
   dictionary                         A dict object containing connection details.
   added in 2.5
     auth_provider                    Configures the auth provider for to obtain authentication tokens from the remote device.
     string                           This option is really used when working with BIG-IQ devices.
     password                         The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP.
     string /                         You may omit this option by setting the environment variable F5_PASSWORD.
     required                         aliases: pass, pwd
     server                           The BIG-IP host.
     string /                         You may omit this option by setting the environment variable F5_SERVER.
     required
     server_port     Default:         The BIG-IP server port.
     integer         443              You may omit this option by setting the environment variable F5_SERVER_PORT.
     ssh_keyfile                      Specifies the SSH keyfile to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This argument is only used for cli transports.
     path                             You may omit this option by setting the environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE.
     timeout                          Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before the
     integer                          operation is completed, the module will error.
     transport         Choices:
     string            • cli          Configures the transport connection to use when connecting to the remote device.

     required
     validate_certs    Choices:       If no, SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates.
     boolean           • no           You may omit this option by setting the environment variable F5_VALIDATE_CERTS.

   state               Choices:       When present, ensures that the route exists.
   string              • present ←    When absent, ensures the route is removed.
                       • absent

NOTES                   *bigip_message_routing_protocol-notes*

   Note

     • Requires BIG-IP >= 14.0.0
     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
