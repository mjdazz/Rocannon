RETURN VALUES                   *gcp_compute_backend_bucket_info-return values*

   Common return values are documented here, the following are the fields unique to this module:

               Key             Returned                                                                          Description

     string
     cdnPolicy                 success  Cloud CDN configuration for this Backend Bucket.
     complex
                                        Maximum number of seconds the response to a signed URL request will be considered fresh. Defaults to 1hr (3600s). After this time period, the response will
       signedUrlCacheMaxAgeSec success  be revalidated before being served.
       integer                          When serving responses to signed URL requests, Cloud CDN will internally behave as though all responses from this backend had a "Cache-Control: public,
                                        max-age=[TTL]" header, regardless of any existing Cache-Control header. The actual headers served in responses will not be altered.
     creationTimestamp         success  Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
     string
     description               success  An optional textual description of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created.

     enableCdn                 success  If true, enable Cloud CDN for this BackendBucket.
     boolean
     id                        success  Unique identifier for the resource.
     integer
     name                               Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the
