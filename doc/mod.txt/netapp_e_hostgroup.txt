NOTES                   *netapp_e_hostgroup-notes*

   Note

     • The E-Series Ansible modules require either an instance of the Web Services Proxy (WSP), to be available to manage the storage-system, or an E-Series storage-system that supports the
       Embedded Web Services API.
     • Embedded Web Services is currently available on the E2800, E5700, EF570, and newer hardware models.
     • netapp_e_storage_system may be utilized for configuring the systems managed by a WSP instance.
