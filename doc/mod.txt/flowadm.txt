SYNOPSIS                   *flowadm*

     • Create/modify/remove networking bandwidth and associated resources for a type of traffic on a particular link.

PARAMETERS                   *flowadm-parameters*

   Parameter  Choices/Defaults                                                                                Comments
   dsfield                     - Identifies the 8-bit differentiated services field (as defined in RFC 2474). The optional dsfield_mask is used to state the bits of interest in the differentiated
   -                           services field when comparing with the dsfield value. Both values must be in hexadecimal.
   link                        Specifiies a link to configure flow on.
   -
   local_ip                    Identifies a network flow by the local IP address.
   -
   local_port                  Identifies a service specified by the local port.
   -
   maxbw                       - Sets the full duplex bandwidth for the flow. The bandwidth is specified as an integer with one of the scale suffixes(K, M, or G for Kbps, Mbps, and Gbps). If no
   -                           units are specified, the input value will be read as Mbps.
   name                        - A flow is defined as a set of attributes based on Layer 3 and Layer 4 headers, which can be used to identify a protocol, service, or a zone.
   - /                         aliases: flow
   required
                Choices:
   priority     • low          Sets the relative priority for the flow.
   -            • medium ←
                • high
   remote_ip                   Identifies a network flow by the remote IP address.
   -
                Choices:
   state        • absent       Create/delete/enable/disable an IP address on the network interface.
   -            • present ←
                • resetted
   temporary    Choices:
   boolean      • no ←         Specifies that the configured flow is temporary. Temporary flows do not persist across reboots.
                • yes
   transport                   - Specifies a Layer 4 protocol to be used. It is typically used in combination with local_port to identify the service that needs special attention.
