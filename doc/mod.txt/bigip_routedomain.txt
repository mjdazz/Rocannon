   bwc_policy                            The bandwidth controller for the route domain.
   string
   connection_limit                      The maximum number of concurrent connections allowed for the route domain. Setting this to 0 turns off connection limits.
   integer
   description                           Specifies descriptive text that identifies the route domain.
   string
   flow_eviction_policy                  The eviction policy to use with this route domain. Apply an eviction policy to provide customized responses to flow overflows and slow flows on the route

                                         The unique identifying integer representing the route domain.
   id                                    This field is required when creating a new route domain.
   integer                               In version 2.5, this value is no longer used to reference a route domain when making modifications to it (for instance during update and delete operations).
                                         Instead, the name parameter is used. In version 2.6, the name value will become a required parameter.
   name
   string                                The name of the route domain.
   added in 2.5

   string
   partition            Default:
   string               "Common"         Partition to create the route domain on. Partitions cannot be updated once they are created.

NOTES                   *bigip_routedomain-notes*

   Note

     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
