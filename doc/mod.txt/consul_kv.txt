SYNOPSIS                   *consul_kv*

     • Allows the retrieval, addition, modification and deletion of key/value entries in a consul cluster via the agent. The entire contents of the record, including the indices, flags and session
       are returned as value.
     • If the key represents a prefix then note that when a value is removed, the existing value if any is returned as part of the results.
     • See http://www.consul.io/docs/agent/http.html#kv for more details.
