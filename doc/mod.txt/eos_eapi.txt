     • When enabling eAPI access the default is to enable HTTP on port 80, enable HTTPS on port 443, disable local HTTP, and disable Unix socket server. Use the options listed below to override the
       default configuration.
     • Requires EOS v4.12 or greater.

                                    Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device. If authorize is false, then this argument does nothing. If the value is
                                    not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS will be used instead.

                                    Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands. If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all commands
                                    in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE will be used instead.
   config                           The module, by default, will connect to the remote device and retrieve the current running-config to use as a base for comparing against the contents of source.
   -                                There are times when it is not desirable to have the task get the current running-config for every task in a playbook. The config argument allows the implementer
                                    to pass in the configuration to use as the base config for comparison.
   http              Choices:       The http argument controls the operating state of the HTTP transport protocol when eAPI is present in the running-config. When the value is set to True, the HTTP
   boolean           • no ←         protocol is enabled and when the value is set to False, the HTTP protocol is disabled. By default, when eAPI is first configured, the HTTP protocol is disabled.
                     • yes          aliases: enable_http
   http_port       Default:         Configures the HTTP port that will listen for connections when the HTTP transport protocol is enabled. This argument accepts integer values in the valid range of

                     Choices:       The https argument controls the operating state of the HTTPS transport protocol when eAPI is present in the running-config. When the value is set to True, the
   https             • no           HTTPS protocol is enabled and when the value is set to False, the HTTPS protocol is disabled. By default, when eAPI is first configured, the HTTPS protocol is
   boolean           • yes ←        enabled.
                                    aliases: enable_https
   https_port      Default:         Configures the HTTP port that will listen for connections when the HTTP transport protocol is enabled. This argument accepts integer values in the valid range of

                     Choices:       The local_http argument controls the operating state of the local HTTP transport protocol when eAPI is present in the running-config. When the value is set to
   local_http        • no ←         True, the HTTP protocol is enabled and restricted to connections from localhost only. When the value is set to False, the HTTP local protocol is disabled.
   boolean           • yes          Note is value is independent of the http argument
                                    aliases: enable_local_http
   local_http_port Default:         Configures the HTTP port that will listen for connections when the HTTP transport protocol is enabled. This argument accepts integer values in the valid range of

    auth_pass                       Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device. If authorize is false, then this argument does nothing. If the value is
    string                          not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS will be used instead.
    authorize        Choices:       Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands. If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all commands
    boolean          • no ←         in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE will be used instead.

    host                            Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport. The value of host is used as the destination address for
    string /                        the transport.
    required
    password                        Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This is a common argument used for either cli or eapi transports. If the value
    string                          is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD will be used instead.
    port           Default:         Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device. This value applies to either cli or eapi.
    integer        0                The port value will default to the appropriate transport common port if none is provided in the task (cli=22, http=80, https=443).
    ssh_keyfile                     Specifies the SSH keyfile to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This argument is only used for cli transports. If the value is not
    path                            specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE will be used instead.
    timeout                         Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before the
    integer                         operation is completed, the module will error.
    transport        Choices:
    string /         • cli ←        Configures the transport connection to use when connecting to the remote device.
    required         • eapi
    use_proxy        Choices:

    use_ssl          Choices:
    boolean          • no           Configures the transport to use SSL if set to yes only when the transport=eapi. If the transport argument is not eapi, this value is ignored.
                     • yes ←
    username                        Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate either the CLI login or the eAPI
    string                          authentication depending on which transport is used. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will be
                                    used instead.
    validate_certs   Choices:       If no, SSL certificates will not be validated. This should only be used on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. If the transport argument
    boolean          • no           is not eapi, this value is ignored.
                     • yes ←
                     Choices:       The socket argument controls the operating state of the UNIX Domain Socket used to receive eAPI requests. When the value of this argument is set to True, the UDS
   socket            • no ←         will listen for eAPI requests. When the value is set to False, the UDS will not be available to handle requests. By default when eAPI is first configured, the
   boolean           • yes          UDS is disabled.

   state             Choices:       The state argument controls the operational state of eAPI on the remote device. When this argument is set to started, eAPI is enabled to receive requests and
   -                 • started ←    when this argument is stopped, eAPI is disabled and will not receive requests.
                     • stopped
   vrf             Default:         The vrf argument will configure eAPI to listen for connections in the specified VRF. By default, eAPI transports will listen for connections in the global table.
   -               "default"        This value requires the VRF to already be created otherwise the task will fail.
