                                         The interface policy controls.
                         Choices:        This is a list of one or more of the following controls:
   controls              • advert-subnet advert-subnet -- Advertise IP subnet instead of a host mask in the router LSA.
   list                  • bfd           bfd -- Bidirectional Forwarding Detection
                         • mtu-ignore    mtu-ignore -- Disables MTU mismatch detection on an interface.
                         • passive       passive -- The interface does not participate in the OSPF protocol and will not establish adjacencies or send routing updates. However the interface is
                                         announced as part of the routing network.
                                         The OSPF cost of the interface.
                                         The cost (also called metric) of an interface in OSPF is an indication of the overhead required to send packets across a certain interface. The cost of an
                                         interface is inversely proportional to the bandwidth of that interface. A higher bandwidth indicates a lower cost. There is more overhead (higher cost) and
   cost                                  time delays involved in crossing a 56k serial line than crossing a 10M ethernet line. The formula used to calculate the cost is cost= 10000 0000/bandwith in
   integer                               bps For example, it will cost 10 EXP8/10 EXP7 = 10 to cross a 10M Ethernet line and will cost 10 EXP8/1544000 = 64 to cross a T1 line.
                                         By default, the cost of an interface is calculated based on the bandwidth; you can force the cost of an interface with the ip ospf cost value interface
                                         subconfiguration mode command.
                                         Accepted values range between 1 and 450.
                                         The APIC defaults to 0 when unset during creation.
                                         The interval between hello packets from a neighbor before the router declares the neighbor as down.
                                         This value must be the same for all networking devices on a specific network.
   dead_interval                         Specifying a smaller dead interval (seconds) will give faster detection of a neighbor being down and improve convergence, but might cause more routing
   integer                               instability.
