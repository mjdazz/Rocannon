                                             Specifies the weight of the topology record.
                                             The system finds the weight of the first topology record that matches the server object (pool or pool member) and the local DNS. The system then assigns
   weight                                    that weight as the topology score for that server object.
   integer                                   The system load balances to the server object with the highest topology score.
                                             If the system finds no topology record that matches both the server object and the local DNS, then the system assigns that server object a zero score.
                                             If the option is not specified when the record is created the system will set it at a default value of 1
                                             Valid range is (0 - 4294967295)

NOTES                   *bigip_gtm_topology_record-notes*

   Note

     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
