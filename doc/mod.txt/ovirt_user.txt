NOTES                   *ovirt_user-notes*

   Note

     • In order to use this module you have to install oVirt Python SDK. To ensure it’s installed with correct version you can create the following task: pip: name=ovirt-engine-sdk-python
       version=4.3.0

EXAMPLES                   *ovirt_user-examples*

 # Examples don't contain auth parameter for simplicity,
 # look at ovirt_auth module to see how to reuse authentication:

 # Add user user1 from authorization provider example.com-authz
 - ovirt_user:
     name: user1
     domain: example.com-authz

 # Add user user1 from authorization provider example.com-authz
 # In case of Active Directory specify UPN:
 - ovirt_user:
     name: [email protected]
     domain: example.com-authz

 # Remove user user1 with authorization provider example.com-authz
 - ovirt_user:
     state: absent
     name: user1
     authz_name: example.com-authz
