SYNOPSIS                   *ovirt_auth*

     • This module authenticates to oVirt/RHV engine and creates SSO token, which should be later used in all other oVirt/RHV modules, so all modules don’t need to perform login and logout. This
       module returns an Ansible fact called ovirt_auth. Every module can use this fact as auth parameter, to perform authentication.

REQUIREMENTS                   *ovirt_auth-requirements*

   The below requirements are needed on the host that executes this module.

     • python >= 2.7
     • ovirt-engine-sdk-python >= 4.3.0

   Parameter Choices/Defaults                                                                                Comments
   ca_file                    A PEM file containing the trusted CA certificates. The certificate presented by the server will be verified using these CA certificates. If ca_file parameter is not
   -                          set, system wide CA certificate store is used. Default value is set by OVIRT_CAFILE environment variable.
   compress    Choices:       A boolean flag indicating if the SDK should ask the server to send compressed responses. The default is True. Note that this is a hint for the server, and that it may
   boolean     • no           return uncompressed data even when this parameter is set to True.
               • yes
   headers
   -                          A dictionary of HTTP headers to be added to each API call.
   added in
   2.4
   hostname
   -                          A string containing the hostname of the server. For example: server.example.com. Default value is set by OVIRT_HOSTNAME environment variable.
   added in                   Either url or hostname is required.
   2.6
   insecure    Choices:
   boolean     • no           A boolean flag that indicates if the server TLS certificate and host name should be checked.
               • yes
   kerberos    Choices:
   boolean     • no           A boolean flag indicating if Kerberos authentication should be used instead of the default basic authentication.
               • yes
   password                   The password of the user. Default value is set by OVIRT_PASSWORD environment variable.
   -
   state       Choices:
   -           • present ←    Specifies if a token should be created or revoked.
               • absent
   timeout                    The maximum total time to wait for the response, in seconds. A value of zero (the default) means wait forever. If the timeout expires before the response is received
   -                          an exception will be raised.
   token
   -                          SSO token to be used instead of login with username/password. Default value is set by OVIRT_TOKEN environment variable.
   added in
   2.5
   url                        A string containing the API URL of the server. For example: https://server.example.com/ovirt-engine/api. Default value is set by OVIRT_URL environment variable.
   -                          Either url or hostname is required.
   username                   The name of the user. For example: [email protected] Default value is set by OVIRT_USERNAME environment variable.

NOTES                   *ovirt_auth-notes*

   Note

     • Everytime you use ovirt_auth module to obtain ticket, you need to also revoke the ticket, when you no longer need it, otherwise the ticket would be revoked by engine when it expires. For an
       example of how to achieve that, please take a look at examples section.
     • In order to use this module you have to install oVirt/RHV Python SDK. To ensure it’s installed with correct version you can create the following task: pip: name=ovirt-engine-sdk-python
       version=4.3.0
     • Note that in oVirt/RHV 4.1 if you want to use a user which is not administrator you must enable the ENGINE_API_FILTER_BY_DEFAULT variable in engine. In oVirt/RHV 4.2 and later it’s enabled
       by default.

EXAMPLES                   *ovirt_auth-examples*

   - block:
        # Create a vault with `ovirt_password` variable which store your
        # oVirt/RHV user's password, and include that yaml file with variable:
        - include_vars: ovirt_password.yml

        - name: Obtain SSO token with using username/password credentials
          ovirt_auth:
            url: https://ovirt.example.com/ovirt-engine/api
            username: [email protected]
            ca_file: ca.pem
            password: "{{ ovirt_password }}"

        # Previous task generated I(ovirt_auth) fact, which you can later use
        # in different modules as follows:
        - ovirt_vm:
            auth: "{{ ovirt_auth }}"
            state: absent
            name: myvm

     always:
       - name: Always revoke the SSO token
         ovirt_auth:
           state: absent
           ovirt_auth: "{{ ovirt_auth }}"

 # When user will set following environment variables:
 #   OVIRT_URL = https://fqdn/ovirt-engine/api
 #   OVIRT_USERNAME = [email protected]
 #   OVIRT_PASSWORD = the_password
 # User can login the oVirt using environment variable instead of variables
 # in yaml file.
 # This is mainly useful when using Ansible Tower or AWX, as it will work
 # for Red Hat Virtualization credentials type.
   - name: Obtain SSO token
     ovirt_auth:
       state: present
