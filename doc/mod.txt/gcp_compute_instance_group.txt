SYNOPSIS                   *gcp_compute_instance_group*

     • Represents an Instance Group resource. Instance groups are self-managed and can contain identical or different instances. Instance groups do not use an instance template. Unlike managed
       instance groups, you must create and add instances to an instance group manually.

REQUIREMENTS                   *gcp_compute_instance_group-requirements*

   The below requirements are needed on the host that executes this module.

     • python >= 2.6
     • requests >= 2.18.4
     • google-auth >= 1.3.0

   list                                        This allows the system to reference ports by the assigned name instead of a port number. Named ports can also contain multiple ports.
                                               For example: [{name: "http", port: 80},{name: "http", port: 8080}] Named ports apply to all instances in this instance group.

NOTES                   *gcp_compute_instance_group-notes*

   Note

     • for authentication, you can set service_account_file using the c(gcp_service_account_file) env variable.
     • for authentication, you can set service_account_contents using the c(GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CONTENTS) env variable.
     • For authentication, you can set service_account_email using the GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL env variable.
     • For authentication, you can set auth_kind using the GCP_AUTH_KIND env variable.
     • For authentication, you can set scopes using the GCP_SCOPES env variable.
     • Environment variables values will only be used if the playbook values are not set.
     • The service_account_email and service_account_file options are mutually exclusive.
