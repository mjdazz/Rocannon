PARAMETERS                   *bigip_firewall_address_list-parameters*

      Parameter    Choices/Defaults                                                                             Comments
   address_lists                    Simple list of existing address lists to add to this list. Address lists can be specified in either their fully qualified name (/Common/foo) or their short name
   list                             (foo). If a short name is used, the partition argument will automatically be prepended to the short name.
   address_ranges                   A list of address ranges where the range starts with a port number, is followed by a dash (-) and then a second number.
   list                             If the first address is greater than the second number, the numbers will be reversed so-as to be properly formatted. ie, 2.2.2.2-1.1.1. would become
                                    1.1.1.1-2.2.2.2.
   addresses                        Individual addresses that you want to add to the list. These addresses differ from ranges, and lists of lists such as what can be used in address_ranges and
   list                             address_lists respectively.
                                    This list can also include networks that have CIDR notation.
   description                      Description of the address list
   string
                                    A list of fully qualified domain names (FQDNs).
   fqdns                            An FQDN has at least one decimal point in it, separating the host from the domain.
   list                             To add FQDNs to a list requires that a global FQDN resolver be configured. At the moment, this must either be done via bigip_command, or, in the GUI of BIG-IP.
                                    If using bigip_command, this can be done with tmsh modify security firewall global-fqdn-policy FOO where FOO is a DNS resolver configured at tmsh create net
                                    dns-resolver FOO.
   geo_locations                    List of geolocations specified by their country and region.

NOTES                   *bigip_firewall_address_list-notes*

   Note

     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
