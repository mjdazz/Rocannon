SYNOPSIS                   *bigip_profile_tcp*

     • Manage TCP profiles on a BIG-IP. Many TCP profiles; each with their own adjustments to the standard tcp profile. Users of this module should be aware that many of the adjustable knobs have
       no module default. Instead, the default is assigned by the BIG-IP system itself which, in most cases, is acceptable.

PARAMETERS                   *bigip_profile_tcp-parameters*

             Parameter            Choices/Defaults                                                                      Comments
   early_retransmit                 Choices:       When yes the system uses early fast retransmits to reduce the recovery time for connections that are receive-buffer or user-data limited.
   boolean                          • no           When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent profile.

                                                   Specifies the length of time that a connection is idle (has no traffic) before the connection is eligible for deletion.
   idle_timeout                                    When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the remote device will choose a default value appropriate for the profile, based
   string                                          on its parent profile.
                                                   When a number is specified, indicates the number of seconds that the TCP connection can remain idle before the system deletes it.
                                                   When 0, or indefinite, specifies that the system does not delete TCP connections regardless of how long they remain idle.

NOTES                   *bigip_profile_tcp-notes*

   Note

     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
