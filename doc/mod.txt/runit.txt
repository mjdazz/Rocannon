    Parameter  Choices/Defaults                                                                               Comments
   enabled       Choices:
   boolean       • no           Whether the service is enabled or not, if disabled it also implies stopped.

   name
   string /                     Name of the service to manage.
   required
   service_dir Default:         directory runsv watches for services

   service_src Default:         directory where services are defined, the source of symlinks to service_dir.
   string      "/etc/sv"
                 Choices:
                 • killed
   state         • once         started/stopped are idempotent actions that will not run commands unless necessary. restarted will always bounce the service (sv restart) and killed will always
