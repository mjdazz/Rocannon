   boolean                • no ←         Should this configuration be applied immediately, if set as permanent.

   interface                             The interface you would like to add/remove to/from a zone in firewalld.
   string
   masquerade                            The masquerade setting you would like to enable/disable to/from zones within firewalld.

   permanent              Choices:       Should this configuration be in the running firewalld configuration or persist across reboots.
   boolean                • no           As of Ansible 2.3, permanent operations can operate on firewalld configs when it is not running (requires firewalld >= 3.0.9).
                          • yes          Note that if this is no, immediate is assumed yes.
   port                                  Name of a port or port range to add/remove to/from firewalld.
   string                                Must be in the form PORT/PROTOCOL or PORT-PORT/PROTOCOL for port ranges.
   rich_rule                             Rich rule to add/remove to/from firewalld.
   string
   service                               Name of a service to add/remove to/from firewalld.
   string                                The service must be listed in output of firewall-cmd --get-services.
   source                                The source/network you would like to add/remove to/from firewalld.
   string
                          Choices:
   state                  • absent       Enable or disable a setting.
   string / required      • disabled     For ports: Should this port accept (enabled) or reject (disabled) connections.
                          • enabled      The states present and absent can only be used in zone level operations (i.e. when no other parameters but zone and state are set).
                          • present
   timeout              Default:         The amount of time the rule should be in effect for when non-permanent.
   integer              0
                                         The firewalld zone to add/remove to/from.
   zone                                  Note that the default zone can be configured per system but public is default from upstream.
   string                                Available choices can be extended based on per-system configs, listed here are "out of the box" defaults.
                                         Possible values include block, dmz, drop, external, home, internal, public, trusted, work.

NOTES                   *firewalld-notes*

   Note

     • Not tested on any Debian based system.
     • Requires the python2 bindings of firewalld, which may not be installed by default.
     • For distributions where the python2 firewalld bindings are unavailable (e.g Fedora 28 and later) you will have to set the ansible_python_interpreter for these hosts to the python3
       interpreter path and install the python3 bindings.
     • Zone transactions (creating, deleting) can be performed by using only the zone and state parameters “present” or “absent”. Note that zone transactions must explicitly be permanent. This is a
       limitation in firewalld. This also means that you will have to reload firewalld after adding a zone that you wish to perform immediate actions on. The module will not take care of this for
       you implicitly because that would undo any previously performed immediate actions which were not permanent. Therefore, if you require immediate access to a newly created zone it is
       recommended you reload firewalld immediately after the zone creation returns with a changed state and before you perform any other immediate, non-permanent actions on that zone.
