     auth_pass                                        Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device. If authorize is false, then this argument does
     string                                           nothing. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS will be used instead.
     added in 2.5.3
     authorize            Choices:                    Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands. If not specified, the device will attempt to
     boolean              • no ←                      execute all commands in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE
     added in 2.5.3       • yes                       will be used instead.
     host                                             Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport. The value of host is used as the
     string / required                                destination address for the transport.
     password                                         Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This is a common argument used for either cli or nxapi
     string                                           transports. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD will be used instead.
     port               Default:                      Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device. This value applies to either cli or nxapi. The port value will
     integer            "0 (use common port)"         default to the appropriate transport common port if none is provided in the task. (cli=22, http=80, https=443).
     ssh_keyfile                                      Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This argument is only used for the cli transport. If the
     string                                           value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE will be used instead.
     timeout            Default:                      Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is
     integer            10                            exceeded before the operation is completed, the module will error. NX-API can be slow to return on long-running commands (sh mac, sh bgp, etc).
     transport            Choices:                    Configures the transport connection to use when connecting to the remote device. The transport argument supports connectivity to the device
     string / required    • cli ←                     over cli (ssh) or nxapi.

     boolean              • no                        If no, the environment variables http_proxy and https_proxy will be ignored.
     added in 2.5         • yes ←
     use_ssl              Choices:
     boolean              • no ←                      Configures the transport to use SSL if set to yes only when the transport=nxapi, otherwise this value is ignored.
                          • yes
     username                                         Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate either the CLI login or
     string                                           the nxapi authentication depending on which transport is used. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable
                                                      ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will be used instead.
     validate_certs       Choices:                    If no, SSL certificates will not be validated. This should only be used on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. If the
     boolean              • no                        transport argument is not nxapi, this value is ignored.
