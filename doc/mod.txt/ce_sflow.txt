   -                                        interval is 65535. If you set the sampling interval to be larger than 65535, the switch automatically restores it to 65535. The value is an integer or
                                            'all'.

   -
   sample_rate                              Specifies the flow sampling rate in the format 1/rate. The value is an integer and ranges from 1 to 4294967295. The default value is 8192.

   -
   state                     Choices:
   -                         • present ←    Determines whether the config should be present or not on the device.

NOTES                   *ce_sflow-notes*

   Note

     • This module requires the netconf system service be enabled on the remote device being managed.
     • Recommended connection is netconf.
     • This module also works with local connections for legacy playbooks.
