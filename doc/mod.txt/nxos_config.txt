SYNOPSIS                   *nxos_config*

     • Cisco NXOS configurations use a simple block indent file syntax for segmenting configuration into sections. This module provides an implementation for working with NXOS configuration
       sections in a deterministic way. This module works with either CLI or NXAPI transports.

PARAMETERS                   *nxos_config-parameters*

       Parameter     Choices/Defaults                                                                            Comments
   after                              The ordered set of commands to append to the end of the command stack if a change needs to be made. Just like with before this allows the playbook designer to
   -                                  append a set of commands to be executed after the command set.
   backup              Choices:       This argument will cause the module to create a full backup of the current running-config from the remote device before any changes are made. If the
   boolean             • no ←         backup_options value is not given, the backup file is written to the backup folder in the playbook root directory or role root directory, if playbook is part
                       • yes          of an ansible role. If the directory does not exist, it is created.
   backup_options                     This is a dict object containing configurable options related to backup file path. The value of this option is read only when backup is set to True, if backup
   dictionary                         is set to false this option will be silently ignored.
   added in 2.8
     dir_path                         This option provides the path ending with directory name in which the backup configuration file will be stored. If the directory does not exist it will be
     path                             created and the filename is either the value of filename or default filename as described in filename options description. If the path value is not given in
                                      that case a backup directory will be created in the current working directory and backup configuration will be copied in filename within backup directory.
     filename                         The filename to be used to store the backup configuration. If the the filename is not given it will be generated based on the hostname, current time and date
     -                                in format defined by <hostname>_config.<current-date>@<current-time>
   before                             The ordered set of commands to push on to the command stack if a change needs to be made. This allows the playbook designer the opportunity to perform
   -                                  configuration commands prior to pushing any changes without affecting how the set of commands are matched against the system.
   defaults            Choices:       The defaults argument will influence how the running-config is collected from the device. When the value is set to true, the command used to collect the
   boolean             • no ←         running-config is append with the all keyword. When the value is set to false, the command is issued without the all keyword
                       • yes
                                      When using the ansible-playbook --diff command line argument the module can generate diffs against different sources.
   diff_against        Choices:       When this option is configure as startup, the module will return the diff of the running-config against the startup-config.
   -                   • startup ←    When this option is configured as intended, the module will return the diff of the running-config against the configuration provided in the intended_config
   added in 2.4        • intended     argument.
                       • running      When this option is configured as running, the module will return the before and after diff of the running-config with respect to any changes made to the
                                      device configuration.
   diff_ignore_lines                  Use this argument to specify one or more lines that should be ignored during the diff. This is used for lines in the configuration that are automatically
   -                                  updated by the system. This argument takes a list of regular expressions or exact line matches.
   added in 2.4
   intended_config                    The intended_config provides the master configuration that the node should conform to and is used to check the final running-config against. This argument will
   -                                  not modify any settings on the remote device and is strictly used to check the compliance of the current device's configuration against. When specifying this
   added in 2.4                       argument, the task should also modify the diff_against value and set it to intended.
   lines                              The ordered set of commands that should be configured in the section. The commands must be the exact same commands as found in the device running-config. Be
   -                                  sure to note the configuration command syntax as some commands are automatically modified by the device config parser.
                                      aliases: commands
                       Choices:
   match               • line ←       Instructs the module on the way to perform the matching of the set of commands against the current device config. If match is set to line, commands are matched
   -                   • strict       line by line. If match is set to strict, command lines are matched with respect to position. If match is set to exact, command lines must be an equal match.
                       • exact        Finally, if match is set to none, the module will not attempt to compare the source configuration with the running configuration on the remote device.
                       • none
   parents                            The ordered set of parents that uniquely identify the section or hierarchy the commands should be checked against. If the parents argument is omitted, the
   -                                  commands are checked against the set of top level or global commands.

                                      A dict object containing connection details.
     auth_pass                        Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device. If authorize is false, then this argument does nothing. If the value
     string                           is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS will be used instead.
     added in 2.5.3
     authorize         Choices:       Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands. If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all
     boolean           • no ←         commands in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE will be used instead.
     added in 2.5.3    • yes
     host                             Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport. The value of host is used as the destination address
     string /                         for the transport.
     required
     password                         Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This is a common argument used for either cli or nxapi transports. If the
     string                           value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD will be used instead.
     port            Default:         Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device. This value applies to either cli or nxapi. The port value will default to the
     integer         "0 (use common   appropriate transport common port if none is provided in the task. (cli=22, http=80, https=443).
                     port)"
     ssh_keyfile                      Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This argument is only used for the cli transport. If the value is not
     string                           specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE will be used instead.
     timeout         Default:         Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before the
     integer         10               operation is completed, the module will error. NX-API can be slow to return on long-running commands (sh mac, sh bgp, etc).
     transport         Choices:       Configures the transport connection to use when connecting to the remote device. The transport argument supports connectivity to the device over cli (ssh) or
     string /          • cli ←        nxapi.
     required          • nxapi
     use_proxy         Choices:
     boolean           • no           If no, the environment variables http_proxy and https_proxy will be ignored.
     added in 2.5      • yes ←
     use_ssl           Choices:
     boolean           • no ←         Configures the transport to use SSL if set to yes only when the transport=nxapi, otherwise this value is ignored.
                       • yes
     username                         Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate either the CLI login or the nxapi
     string                           authentication depending on which transport is used. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will be
                                      used instead.
     validate_certs    Choices:       If no, SSL certificates will not be validated. This should only be used on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. If the transport
     boolean           • no           argument is not nxapi, this value is ignored.
                       • yes ←
                       Choices:       Instructs the module on the way to perform the configuration on the device. If the replace argument is set to line then the modified lines are pushed to the
   replace             • line ←       device in configuration mode. If the replace argument is set to block then the entire command block is pushed to the device in configuration mode if any line
   -                   • block        is not correct. replace config is supported only on Nexus 9K device.
                       • config
   replace_src                        The replace_src argument provides path to the configuration file to load into the remote system. This argument is used to replace the entire config with a
   -                                  flat-file. This is used with argument replace with value config. This is mutually exclusive with the lines and src arguments. This argument is supported on
   added in 2.5                       Nexus 9K device. Use nxos_file_copy module to copy the flat file to remote device and then use the path with this argument.
   running_config                     The module, by default, will connect to the remote device and retrieve the current running-config to use as a base for comparing against the contents of
   -                                  source. There are times when it is not desirable to have the task get the current running-config for every task in a playbook. The running_config argument
   added in 2.4                       allows the implementer to pass in the configuration to use as the base config for comparison.

                       Choices:       When changes are made to the device running-configuration, the changes are not copied to non-volatile storage by default. Using this argument will change that
   save_when           • always       before. If the argument is set to always, then the running-config will always be copied to the startup-config and the modified flag will always be set to True.
