SYNOPSIS                   *dellos10_command*

     • Sends arbitrary commands to a Dell EMC OS10 node and returns the results read from the device. This module includes an argument that will cause the module to wait for a specific condition
       before returning or timing out if the condition is not met.
     • This module does not support running commands in configuration mode. Please use dellos10_config to configure Dell EMC OS10 devices.

PARAMETERS                   *dellos10_command-parameters*

    Parameter   Choices/Defaults                                                                               Comments
   commands                      List of commands to send to the remote dellos10 device over the configured provider. The resulting output from the command is returned. If the wait_for argument is
   list /                        provided, the module is not returned until the condition is satisfied or the number of retries has expired.
   required
   interval     Default:         Configures the interval in seconds to wait between retries of the command. If the command does not pass the specified conditions, the interval indicates how long to
   integer      1                wait before trying the command again.
   match          Choices:       The match argument is used in conjunction with the wait_for argument to specify the match policy. Valid values are all or any. If the value is set to all then all
   string         • all ←        conditionals in the wait_for must be satisfied. If the value is set to any then only one of the values must be satisfied.
   added in 2.5   • any
   provider                      A dict object containing connection details.
   dictionary
    host                         Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport. The value of host is used as the destination address for
    string /                     the transport.
    required
    password                     Password to authenticate the SSH session to the remote device. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD
    string                       will be used instead.
    port        Default:         Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device.
    integer     22
    ssh_keyfile                  Path to an ssh key used to authenticate the SSH session to the remote device. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable
    path                         ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE will be used instead.
    timeout     Default:         Specifies idle timeout (in seconds) for the connection. Useful if the console freezes before continuing. For example when saving configurations.
    integer     10
    username                     User to authenticate the SSH session to the remote device. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will be
    string                       used instead.
   retries      Default:         Specifies the number of retries a command should be tried before it is considered failed. The command is run on the target device every retry and evaluated against
   integer      10               the wait_for conditions.
   wait_for                      List of conditions to evaluate against the output of the command. The task will wait for each condition to be true before moving forward. If the conditional is not
   list                          true within the configured number of retries, the task fails. See examples.
