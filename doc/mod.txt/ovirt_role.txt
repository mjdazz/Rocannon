NOTES                   *ovirt_role-notes*

   Note

     • In order to use this module you have to install oVirt Python SDK. To ensure it’s installed with correct version you can create the following task: pip: name=ovirt-engine-sdk-python
       version=4.3.0

EXAMPLES                   *ovirt_role-examples*

 # Examples don't contain auth parameter for simplicity,
 # look at ovirt_auth module to see how to reuse authentication:

 # Create administrative role with two permits
 - ovirt_role:
     name: role
     administrative: true
     permits:
       - manipulate_permissions
       - create_instance

 # Remove role
 - ovirt_role:
     name: role
     state: absent

 # Remove all permit
 - ovirt_role:
     name: role
     administrative: ture
     permits:
       - login
