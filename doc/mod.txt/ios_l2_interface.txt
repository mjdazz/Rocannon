                                        Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device. If authorize is false, then this argument does nothing. If the value
                                        is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS will be used instead.

                                        Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands. If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all
                                        commands in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE will be used instead.

       auth_pass                        Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device. If authorize is false, then this argument does nothing. If the value
       string                           is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS will be used instead.
       authorize         Choices:       Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands. If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all

       required
       password                         Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not

       integer         22
       ssh_keyfile                      Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is the path to the key used to authenticate the SSH session. If
       path                             the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE will be used instead.
       timeout         Default:         Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before the
       integer         10               operation is completed, the module will error.
       username                         Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not
       string                           specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will be used instead.

   trunk_allowed_vlans                  List of allowed VLANs in a given trunk port. If mode=trunk, these are the only VLANs that will be configured on the trunk, i.e. "2-10,15".
   -
