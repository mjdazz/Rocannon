SYNOPSIS                   *gcp_compute_region_disk*

     • Persistent disks are durable storage devices that function similarly to the physical disks in a desktop or a server. Compute Engine manages the hardware behind these devices to ensure data
       redundancy and optimize performance for you. Persistent disks are available as either standard hard disk drives (HDD) or solid-state drives (SSD).
     • Persistent disks are located independently from your virtual machine instances, so you can detach or move persistent disks to keep your data even after you delete your instances. Persistent
       disk performance scales automatically with size, so you can resize your existing persistent disks or add more persistent disks to an instance to meet your performance and storage space
       requirements.
     • Add a persistent disk to your instance when you need reliable and affordable storage with consistent performance characteristics.

                                                     Encrypts the disk using a customer-supplied encryption key.
                                                     After you encrypt a disk with a customer-supplied key, you must provide the same key if you use the disk later (e.g. to create a disk snapshot
   disk_encryption_key                               or an image, or to attach the disk to a virtual machine).
   dictionary                                        Customer-supplied encryption keys do not protect access to metadata of the disk.
                                                     If you do not provide an encryption key when creating the disk, then the disk will be encrypted using an automatically generated key and you do
                                                     not need to provide a key to use the disk later.
