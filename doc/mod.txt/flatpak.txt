PARAMETERS                   *flatpak-parameters*

   Parameter  Choices/Defaults                                                                                Comments
   executable Default:         The path to the flatpak executable to use.
   -          "flatpak"        By default, this module looks for the flatpak executable on the path.
   method       Choices:       The installation method to use.
   -            • system ←     Defines if the flatpak is supposed to be installed globally for the whole system or only for the current user.
                • user
                               The name of the flatpak to manage.
                               When used with state=present, name can be specified as an http(s) URL to a flatpakref file or the unique reverse DNS name that identifies a flatpak.
   name                        When supplying a reverse DNS name, you can use the remote option to specify on what remote to look for the flatpak. An example for a reverse DNS name is
   - /                         org.gnome.gedit.
   required                    When used with state=absent, it is recommended to specify the name in the reverse DNS format.
                               When supplying an http(s) URL with state=absent, the module will try to match the installed flatpak based on the name of the flatpakref to remove it. However, there
                               is no guarantee that the names of the flatpakref file and the reverse DNS name of the installed flatpak do match.
   remote     Default:         The flatpak remote (repository) to install the flatpak from.
   -          "flathub"        By default, flathub is assumed, but you do need to add the flathub flatpak_remote before you can use this.
                               See the flatpak_remote module for managing flatpak remotes.
   state        Choices:
   -            • absent       Indicates the desired package state.
                • present ←
