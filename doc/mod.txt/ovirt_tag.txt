NOTES                   *ovirt_tag-notes*

   Note

     • In order to use this module you have to install oVirt Python SDK. To ensure it’s installed with correct version you can create the following task: pip: name=ovirt-engine-sdk-python
       version=4.3.0

EXAMPLES                   *ovirt_tag-examples*

 # Examples don't contain auth parameter for simplicity,
 # look at ovirt_auth module to see how to reuse authentication:

 # Create(if not exists) and assign tag to vms vm1 and vm2:
 - ovirt_tag:
     name: mytag
     vms:
       - vm1
       - vm2

 # Attach a tag to VM 'vm3', keeping the rest already attached tags on VM:
 - ovirt_tag:
     name: mytag
     state: attached
     vms:
       - vm3

 # Detach a tag from VM 'vm3', keeping the rest already attached tags on VM:
 - ovirt_tag:
     name: mytag
     state: detached
     vms:
       - vm3

 # To detach all VMs from tag:
 - ovirt_tag:
     name: mytag
     vms: []

 # Remove tag
 - ovirt_tag:
     state: absent
     name: mytag

 # Change Tag Name
 - ovirt_tag:
     id: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
     name: "new_tag_name"
