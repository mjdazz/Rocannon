SYNOPSIS                   *bigip_tunnel*

     • Manages tunnels on a BIG-IP. Tunnels are usually based upon a tunnel profile which defines both default arguments and constraints for the tunnel.
     • Due to this, this module exposes a number of settings that may or may not be related to the type of tunnel you are working with. It is important that you take this into consideration when
       declaring your tunnel config.
     • If a specific tunnel does not support the parameter you are considering, the documentation of the parameter will usually make mention of this. Otherwise, when configuring that parameter on
       the device, the device will notify you.

PARAMETERS                   *bigip_tunnel-parameters*

       Parameter     Choices/Defaults                                                                             Comments
                       Choices:        Allows you to configure auto last hop on a per-tunnel basis.
   auto_last_hop       • default       When creating a new tunnel, if this parameter is supported by the tunnel profile but not specified, the default is default.
   string              • enabled       When default, means that the system uses the global auto-lasthop setting to send back the request.
                       • disabled      When enabled, allows the system to send return traffic to the MAC address that transmitted the request, even if the routing table points to a different
                                       network or interface. As a result, the system can send return traffic to clients even when there is no matching route.

   string
                                       When applied to a GRE tunnel, this value specifies an optional field in the GRE header, used to authenticate the source of the packet.

                                       When creating a new tunnel, if this parameter is supported by the tunnel profile but not specified, the default value is 0.

   mode                • bidirectional When creating a new tunnel, if this parameter is supported by the tunnel profile but not specified, the default is bidirectional.
   string              • inbound       When bidirectional, specifies that the tunnel carries both inbound and outbound traffic.
                       • outbound      When inbound, specifies that the tunnel carries only incoming traffic.
                                       When outbound, specifies that the tunnel carries only outgoing traffic.

   secondary_address                   Specifies a non-floating IP address for the tunnel, to be used with host-initiated traffic.

   tos                                 When creating a new tunnel, if this parameter is supported by the tunnel profile but not specified, the default value is preserve.
   string                              When preserve, the system copies the TOS value from the inner header to the outer header.
                                       You may also specify a numeric value. The possible values are from 0 to 255.
   traffic_group                       Specifies the traffic group to associate with the tunnel.
   string                              This value cannot be changed after it is set. This is a limitation of BIG-IP.
                       Choices:        Specifies that the tunnel operates in transparent mode.
   transparent         • no            When yes, you can inspect and manipulate the encapsulated traffic flowing through the BIG-IP system.
   boolean             • yes           A transparent tunnel terminates a tunnel while presenting the illusion that the tunnel transits the device unmodified (that is, the BIG-IP system appears as
                                       if it were an intermediate router that simply routes IP traffic through the device).
                       Choices:        Enables or disables the tunnel to use the PMTU (Path MTU) information provided by ICMP NeedFrag error messages.
   use_pmtu            • no            If yes and the tunnel mtu is set to 0, the tunnel will use the PMTU information.
   boolean             • yes           If yes and the tunnel mtu is fixed to a non-zero value, the tunnel will use the minimum of PMTU and MTU.
                                       If no, the tunnel will use fixed MTU or calculate its MTU using tunnel encapsulation configurations.

NOTES                   *bigip_tunnel-notes*

   Note

     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
