RETURN VALUES                   *gcp_compute_forwarding_rule_info-return values*

   Common return values are documented here, the following are the fields unique to this module:

            Key          Returned                                                                             Description
   resources             always   List of resources
   complex
     allPorts            success  For internal TCP/UDP load balancing (i.e. load balancing scheme is INTERNAL and protocol is TCP/UDP), set this to true to allow packets addressed to any ports to
     boolean                      be forwarded to the backends configured with this forwarding rule. Used with backend service. Cannot be set if port or portRange are set.
     backendService      success  A BackendService to receive the matched traffic. This is used only for INTERNAL load balancing.
     dictionary
     creationTimestamp   success  Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
     string
     description         success  An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.
     string
     id                  success  The unique identifier for the resource.
     integer
                                  The IP address that this forwarding rule is serving on behalf of.
                                  Addresses are restricted based on the forwarding rule's load balancing scheme (EXTERNAL or INTERNAL) and scope (global or regional).
                                  When the load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL, for global forwarding rules, the address must be a global IP, and for regional forwarding rules, the address must live
                                  in the same region as the forwarding rule. If this field is empty, an ephemeral IPv4 address from the same scope (global or regional) will be assigned. A regional
     IPAddress                    forwarding rule supports IPv4 only. A global forwarding rule supports either IPv4 or IPv6.
     string              success  When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, this can only be an RFC 1918 IP address belonging to the network/subnet configured for the forwarding rule. By default,
                                  if this field is empty, an ephemeral internal IP address will be automatically allocated from the IP range of the subnet or network configured for this forwarding
                                  rule.
                                  An address can be specified either by a literal IP address or a URL reference to an existing Address resource. The following examples are all valid: " 100.1.2.3 "
                                  https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/regions/region/addresses/address " projects/project/regions/region/addresses/address "
                                  regions/region/addresses/address " global/addresses/address " address .
     IPProtocol          success  The IP protocol to which this rule applies. Valid options are TCP, UDP, ESP, AH, SCTP or ICMP.
     string                       When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, only TCP and UDP are valid.
     ipVersion           success  ipVersion is not a valid field for regional forwarding rules.
     string
     loadBalancingScheme          This signifies what the ForwardingRule will be used for and can only take the following values: INTERNAL, EXTERNAL The value of INTERNAL means that this will be
     string              success  used for Internal Network Load Balancing (TCP, UDP). The value of EXTERNAL means that this will be used for External Load Balancing (HTTP(S) LB, External TCP/UDP
                                  LB, SSL Proxy) .
     name                         Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name
     string              success  must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]"[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all
                                  following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
     network                      For internal load balancing, this field identifies the network that the load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule. If this field is not specified,
     dictionary          success  the default network will be used.
                                  This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.
     networkTier         success  The networking tier used for configuring this address. This field can take the following values: PREMIUM or STANDARD. If this field is not specified, it is assumed
     string                       to be PREMIUM.
                                  This field is used along with the target field for TargetHttpProxy, TargetHttpsProxy, TargetSslProxy, TargetTcpProxy, TargetVpnGateway, TargetPool, TargetInstance.
     portRange                    Applicable only when IPProtocol is TCP, UDP, or SCTP, only packets addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded to target.
     string              success  Forwarding rules with the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair must have disjoint port ranges.
                                  Some types of forwarding target have constraints on the acceptable ports: " TargetHttpProxy: 80, 8080 " TargetHttpsProxy: 443 " TargetTcpProxy: 25, 43, 110, 143,
                                  195, 443, 465, 587, 700, 993, 995, 1883, 5222 " TargetSslProxy: 25, 43, 110, 143, 195, 443, 465, 587, 700, 993, 995, 1883, 5222 " TargetVpnGateway: 500, 4500 .
                                  This field is used along with the backend_service field for internal load balancing.
     ports               success  When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, a single port or a comma separated list of ports can be configured. Only packets addressed to these ports will be
     list                         forwarded to the backends configured with this forwarding rule.
                                  You may specify a maximum of up to 5 ports.
     region              success  A reference to the region where the regional forwarding rule resides.
     string                       This field is not applicable to global forwarding rules.
                                  An optional prefix to the service name for this Forwarding Rule.
                                  If specified, will be the first label of the fully qualified service name.
     serviceLabel        success  The label must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
     string                       Specifically, the label must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]"[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a
                                  lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
                                  This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.
     serviceName         success  The internal fully qualified service name for this Forwarding Rule.
     string                       This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.
     subnetwork          success  The subnetwork that the load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule. This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.
     dictionary                   If the network specified is in auto subnet mode, this field is optional. However, if the network is in custom subnet mode, a subnetwork must be specified.
                                  This field is only used for EXTERNAL load balancing.
     target              success  A reference to a TargetPool resource to receive the matched traffic.
     dictionary                   This target must live in the same region as the forwarding rule.
