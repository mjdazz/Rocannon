NOTES                   *bigip_snmp_trap-notes*

   Note

     • This module only supports version v1 and v2c of SNMP.
     • The network option is not supported on versions of BIG-IP < 12.1.0 because the platform did not support that option until 12.1.0. If used on versions < 12.1.0, it will simply be ignored.
     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
