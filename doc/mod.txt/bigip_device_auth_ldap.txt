PARAMETERS                   *bigip_device_auth_ldap-parameters*

         Parameter       Choices/Defaults                                                                          Comments

   bind_dn                                The BIG-IP client authentication module does not support Active Directory or LDAP servers that do not perform bind referral when authenticating referred

                                          Therefore, if you plan to use Active Directory or LDAP as your authentication source and want to use referred accounts, make sure your servers perform bind

NOTES                   *bigip_device_auth_ldap-notes*

   Note

     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
