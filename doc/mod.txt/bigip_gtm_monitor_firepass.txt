PARAMETERS                   *bigip_gtm_monitor_firepass-parameters*

        Parameter          Choices/Defaults                                                                           Comments
   cipher_list                                 Specifies the list of ciphers for this monitor.
   string                                      The items in the cipher list are separated with the colon : symbol.
                                               When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not specified, the default list is HIGH:!ADH.
                                               Specifies the maximum percentage of licensed connections currently in use under which the monitor marks the Secure Access Manager system up.
   concurrency_limit                           As an example, a setting of 95 percent means that the monitor marks the Secure Access Manager system up until 95 percent of licensed connections are
   integer                                     in use.
                                               When the number of in-use licensed connections exceeds 95 percent, the monitor marks the Secure Access Manager system down.
                                               When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not specified, the default is 95.
                                               Specifies that the monitor allows more than one probe attempt per interval.
   ignore_down_response   Choices:             When yes, specifies that the monitor ignores down responses for the duration of the monitor timeout. Once the monitor timeout is reached without the
   boolean                • no                 system receiving an up response, the system marks the object down.
                          • yes                When no, specifies that the monitor immediately marks an object down when it receives a down response.
                                               When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not provided, then the default value will be no.

   integer                                     If this parameter is not provided when creating a new monitor, then the default value will be 30.
                                               This value must be less than the timeout value.
   ip                                          IP address part of the IP/port definition. If this parameter is not provided when creating a new monitor, then the default value will be '"'.
   string                                      If this value is an IP address, then a port number must be specified.
                                               Specifies the number that the monitor uses to mark the Secure Access Manager system up or down.
   max_load_average                            The system compares the Max Load Average setting against a one-minute average of the Secure Access Manager system load.
   integer                                     When the Secure Access Manager system-load average falls within the specified Max Load Average, the monitor marks the Secure Access Manager system up.
                                               When the average exceeds the setting, the monitor marks the system down.
                                               When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not specified, the default is 12.

   string                                      that if specifying an IP address, a value between 1 and 65535 must be specified.
   probe_timeout                               Specifies the number of seconds after which the system times out the probe request to the system.
   integer                                     When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not provided, then the default value will be 5.

   Note

     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
