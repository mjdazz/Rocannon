SYNOPSIS                   *mount*

     • This module controls active and configured mount points in /etc/fstab.

PARAMETERS                   *mount-parameters*

    Parameter   Choices/Defaults                                                                               Comments
   backup         Choices:
   boolean        • no ←         Create a backup file including the timestamp information so you can get the original file back if you somehow clobbered it incorrectly.
   added in 2.5   • yes
   boot           Choices:       Determines if the filesystem should be mounted on boot.
   boolean        • no           Only applies to Solaris systems.
                  • yes ←
   dump         Default:         Dump (see fstab(5)).
   string       0                Note that if set to null and state set to present, it will cease to work and duplicate entries will be made with subsequent runs.
                                 Has no effect on Solaris systems.
                                 File to use instead of /etc/fstab.
   fstab                         You should not use this option unless you really know what you are doing.
   string                        This might be useful if you need to configure mountpoints in a chroot environment.
                                 OpenBSD does not allow specifying alternate fstab files with mount so do not use this on OpenBSD with any state that operates on the live filesystem.
                                 This parameter defaults to /etc/fstab or /etc/vfstab on Solaris.
   fstype                        Filesystem type.
   string                        Required when state is present or mounted.
   opts                          Mount options (see fstab(5), or vfstab(4) on Solaris).
   string
   passno       Default:         Passno (see fstab(5)).
   string       0                Note that if set to null and state set to present, it will cease to work and duplicate entries will be made with subsequent runs.
                                 Deprecated on Solaris systems.
   path                          Path to the mount point (e.g. /mnt/files).
   path /                        Before Ansible 2.3 this option was only usable as dest, destfile and name.
   required                      aliases: name
   src                           Device to be mounted on path.
   path                          Required when state set to present or mounted.
                  Choices:       If mounted, the device will be actively mounted and appropriately configured in fstab. If the mount point is not present, the mount point will be created.
   state          • absent       If unmounted, the device will be unmounted without changing fstab.
   string /       • mounted      present only specifies that the device is to be configured in fstab and does not trigger or require a mount.
   required       • present      absent specifies that the device mount's entry will be removed from fstab and will also unmount the device and remove the mount point.
                  • unmounted    remounted specifies that the device will be remounted for when you want to force a refresh on the mount itself (added in 2.9). This will always return changed=true.
                  • remounted

NOTES                   *mount-notes*

   Note

     • As of Ansible 2.3, the name option has been changed to path as default, but name still works as well.
