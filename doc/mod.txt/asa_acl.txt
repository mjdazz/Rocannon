SYNOPSIS                   *asa_acl*

     • This module allows you to work with access-lists on a Cisco ASA device.

Parameters¶

    Parameter   Choices/Defaults                                                                               Comments
   after                         The ordered set of commands to append to the end of the command stack if a changed needs to be made. Just like with before this allows the playbook designer to
   -                             append a set of commands to be executed after the command set.
                                 Deprecated
                                 Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using connection: network_cli and become: yes.
                  Choices:       For more information please see the Network Guide.
   authorize      • no ←
   boolean        • yes          ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

                                 Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands. If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all commands in
                                 non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE will be used instead.
   before                        The ordered set of commands to push on to the command stack if a change needs to be made. This allows the playbook designer the opportunity to perform configuration
   -                             commands prior to pushing any changes without affecting how the set of commands are matched against the system.
   config                        The module, by default, will connect to the remote device and retrieve the current running-config to use as a base for comparing against the contents of source.
   -                             There are times when it is not desirable to have the task get the current running-config for every task in a playbook. The config argument allows the implementer to
                                 pass in the configuration to use as the base config for comparison.
   context                       Specifies which context to target if you are running in the ASA in multiple context mode. Defaults to the current context you login to.
   string
   force          Choices:       The force argument instructs the module to not consider the current devices running-config. When set to true, this will cause the module to push the contents of src
   boolean        • no ←         into the device without first checking if already configured.
                  • yes
   lines                         The ordered set of commands that should be configured in the section. The commands must be the exact same commands as found in the device running-config. Be sure to
   - / required                  note the configuration command syntax as some commands are automatically modified by the device config parser.
                                 aliases: commands
                  Choices:
   match          • line ←       Instructs the module on the way to perform the matching of the set of commands against the current device config. If match is set to line, commands are matched line
   -              • strict       by line. If match is set to strict, command lines are matched with respect to position. Finally if match is set to exact, command lines must be an equal match.

    auth_pass                    Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device. If authorize is false, then this argument does nothing. If the value is not
    string                       specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS will be used instead.

    string                       the transport.
    password                     Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not specified

    port        Default:         Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device.
    integer     22
    ssh_keyfile                  Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is the path to the key used to authenticate the SSH session. If the
    path                         value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE will be used instead.
    timeout     Default:         Specifies idle timeout in seconds for the connection, in seconds. Useful if the console freezes before continuing. For example when saving configurations.
    integer     10
    username                     Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not
    string                       specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will be used instead.
   replace        Choices:       Instructs the module on the way to perform the configuration on the device. If the replace argument is set to line then the modified lines are pushed to the device
   -              • line ←       in configuration mode. If the replace argument is set to block then the entire command block is pushed to the device in configuration mode if any line is not
                  • block        correct.
