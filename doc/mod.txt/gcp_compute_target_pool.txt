                              Choices:

                                               This field is applicable only when the containing target pool is serving a forwarding rule as the primary pool, and its failoverRatio field is
                                               properly set to a value between [0, 1].
                                               backupPool and failoverRatio together define the fallback behavior of the primary target pool: if the ratio of the healthy instances in the primary
                                               pool is at or below failoverRatio, traffic arriving at the load-balanced IP will be directed to the backup pool.
   backup_pool                                 In case where failoverRatio and backupPool are not set, or all the instances in the backup pool are unhealthy, the traffic will be directed back to
   dictionary                                  the primary pool in the "force" mode, where traffic will be spread to the healthy instances with the best effort, or to all instances when no instance
                                               is healthy.
                                               This field represents a link to a TargetPool resource in GCP. It can be specified in two ways. First, you can place a dictionary with key 'selfLink'
                                               and value of your resource's selfLink Alternatively, you can add `register: name-of-resource` to a gcp_compute_target_pool task and then set this
                                               backup_pool field to "{{ name-of-resource }}"
   description                                 An optional description of this resource.
   string
   env_type                                    Specifies which Ansible environment you're running this module within.
   string                                      This should not be set unless you know what you're doing.
                                               This only alters the User Agent string for any API requests.
                                               This field is applicable only when the containing target pool is serving a forwarding rule as the primary pool (i.e., not as a backup pool to some
                                               other target pool). The value of the field must be in [0, 1].
   failover_ratio                              If set, backupPool must also be set. They together define the fallback behavior of the primary target pool: if the ratio of the healthy instances in
   string                                      the primary pool is at or below this number, traffic arriving at the load-balanced IP will be directed to the backup pool.
                                               In case where failoverRatio is not set or all the instances in the backup pool are unhealthy, the traffic will be directed back to the primary pool in
                                               the "force" mode, where traffic will be spread to the healthy instances with the best effort, or to all instances when no instance is healthy.
                                               A reference to a HttpHealthCheck resource.
                                               A member instance in this pool is considered healthy if and only if the health checks pass. If not specified it means all member instances will be
   health_check                                considered healthy at all times.
   dictionary                                  This field represents a link to a HttpHealthCheck resource in GCP. It can be specified in two ways. First, you can place a dictionary with key
                                               'selfLink' and value of your resource's selfLink Alternatively, you can add `register: name-of-resource` to a gcp_compute_http_health_check task and
                                               then set this health_check field to "{{ name-of-resource }}"

   string / required                           Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]"[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must
                                               be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
