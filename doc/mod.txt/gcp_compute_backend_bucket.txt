SYNOPSIS                   *gcp_compute_backend_bucket*

     • Backend buckets allow you to use Google Cloud Storage buckets with HTTP(S) load balancing.
     • An HTTP(S) load balancer can direct traffic to specified URLs to a backend bucket rather than a backend service. It can send requests for static content to a Cloud Storage bucket and
       requests for dynamic content a virtual machine instance.

REQUIREMENTS                   *gcp_compute_backend_bucket-requirements*

   The below requirements are needed on the host that executes this module.

     • python >= 2.6
     • requests >= 2.18.4
     • google-auth >= 1.3.0
