   force             Choices:
   boolean           • no ←         When true it forces link aggregation group members to match what is declared in the members param. This can be used to remove members.

   list
   min_links                        Minimum number of ports required up before bringing up the link aggregation group.

                                    Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using connection: network_cli.
                                    This option is only required if you are using NX-API.

                                    A dict object containing connection details.
    auth_pass                       Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device. If authorize is false, then this argument does nothing. If the value is
    string                          not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS will be used instead.
    added in 2.5.3
    authorize        Choices:       Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands. If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all commands
    boolean          • no ←         in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE will be used instead.
    added in 2.5.3   • yes
    host                            Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport. The value of host is used as the destination address for
    string /                        the transport.
    required
    password                        Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This is a common argument used for either cli or nxapi transports. If the
    string                          value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD will be used instead.
    port           Default:         Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device. This value applies to either cli or nxapi. The port value will default to the
    integer        "0 (use common   appropriate transport common port if none is provided in the task. (cli=22, http=80, https=443).
                   port)"
    ssh_keyfile                     Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This argument is only used for the cli transport. If the value is not specified
    string                          in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE will be used instead.
    timeout        Default:         Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before the
    integer        10               operation is completed, the module will error. NX-API can be slow to return on long-running commands (sh mac, sh bgp, etc).
    transport        Choices:       Configures the transport connection to use when connecting to the remote device. The transport argument supports connectivity to the device over cli (ssh) or
    string /         • cli ←        nxapi.
    required         • nxapi
    use_proxy        Choices:
    boolean          • no           If no, the environment variables http_proxy and https_proxy will be ignored.
    added in 2.5     • yes ←
    use_ssl          Choices:
    boolean          • no ←         Configures the transport to use SSL if set to yes only when the transport=nxapi, otherwise this value is ignored.
                     • yes
    username                        Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate either the CLI login or the nxapi
    string                          authentication depending on which transport is used. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will be
                                    used instead.
    validate_certs   Choices:       If no, SSL certificates will not be validated. This should only be used on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. If the transport argument
    boolean          • no           is not nxapi, this value is ignored.
                     • yes ←
   purge             Choices:
   boolean           • no ←         Purge links not defined in the aggregate parameter.
                     • yes
   state             Choices:
   string            • present ←    State of the link aggregation group.
                     • absent

NOTES                   *nxos_linkagg-notes*

   Note

     • Tested against NXOSv 7.0(3)I5(1).
     • state=absent removes the portchannel config and interface if it already exists. If members to be removed are not explicitly passed, all existing members (if any), are removed.
     • Members must be a list.
     • LACP needs to be enabled first if active/passive modes are used.
     • For information on using CLI and NX-API see the NXOS Platform Options guide
     • For more information on using Ansible to manage network devices see the Ansible Network Guide
     • For more information on using Ansible to manage Cisco devices see the Cisco integration page.
