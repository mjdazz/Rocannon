SYNOPSIS                   *ironware_command*

     • Sends arbitrary commands to a Extreme Ironware node and returns the results read from the device. This module includes a wait_for argument that will cause the module to wait for a specific
       condition before returning or timing out if the condition is not met.

PARAMETERS                   *ironware_command-parameters*

                                 Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands. If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all commands in
                                 non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE will be used instead.
   commands                      List of commands to send to the remote device over the configured provider. The resulting output from the command is returned. If the wait_for argument is provided,
   - / required                  the module is not returned until the condition is satisfied or the number of retires as expired.
   interval     Default:         Configures the interval in seconds to wait between retries of the command. If the command does not pass the specified conditions, the interval indicates how long to
   -            1                wait before trying the command again.
   match          Choices:       The match argument is used in conjunction with the wait_for argument to specify the match policy. If the value is set to all then all conditionals in the wait_for
   -              • any          must be satisfied. If the value is set to any then only one of the values must be satisfied.

                                 A dict object containing connection details.
    auth_pass                    Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device. If authorize is false, then this argument does nothing. If the value is not
    string                       specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS will be used instead.

    boolean       • no ←         non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE will be used instead.
                  • yes
    host                         Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport. The value of host is used as the destination address for
    string                       the transport.
    password                     Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not specified
    string                       in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD will be used instead.
    port        Default:         Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device.
    integer     22
    ssh_keyfile                  Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is the path to the key used to authenticate the SSH session. If the
    path                         value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE will be used instead.
    timeout     Default:         Specifies idle timeout in seconds for the connection, in seconds. Useful if the console freezes before continuing. For example when saving configurations.
    integer     10
    username                     Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not
    string                       specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will be used instead.
   retries      Default:         Specifies the number of retries a command should by tried before it is considered failed. The command is run on the target device every retry and evaluated against
   -            10               the wait_for conditions.
   wait_for                      List of conditions to evaluate against the output of the command. The task will wait for each condition to be true before moving forward. If the conditional is not
   -                             true within the configured number of retries, the task fails. See examples.
