SYNOPSIS                   *nxos_facts*

     • Collects facts from Cisco Nexus devices running the NX-OS operating system. Fact collection is supported over both Cli and Nxapi transports. This module prepends all of the base network fact
       keys with ansible_net_<fact>. The facts module will always collect a base set of facts from the device and can enable or disable collection of additional facts.

PARAMETERS                   *nxos_facts-parameters*

          Parameter         Choices/Defaults                                                                         Comments
   gather_network_resources                  When supplied, this argument will restrict the facts collected to a given subset. Possible values for this argument include all and the resources like
   -                                         interfaces, vlans etc. Can specify a list of values to include a larger subset. Values can also be used with an initial ! to specify that a specific
   added in 2.9                              subset should not be collected. Valid subsets are 'all', 'bfd_interfaces', 'lag_interfaces', 'telemetry', 'vlans', 'lacp', 'lacp_interfaces',
                                             'interfaces', 'l3_interfaces', 'l2_interfaces', 'lldp_global'.
   gather_subset            Default:         When supplied, this argument will restrict the facts collected to a given subset. Possible values for this argument include all, hardware, config,
   -                        "!config"        legacy, and interfaces. Can specify a list of values to include a larger subset. Values can also be used with an initial ! to specify that a specific
                                             subset should not be collected.

                                             Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using connection: network_cli.

                                             A dict object containing connection details.
       auth_pass                             Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device. If authorize is false, then this argument does nothing. If the
       string                                value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS will be used instead.
       added in 2.5.3
       authorize              Choices:       Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands. If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all
       boolean                • no ←         commands in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE will be used
       added in 2.5.3         • yes          instead.
       host                                  Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport. The value of host is used as the destination
       string / required                     address for the transport.
       password                              Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This is a common argument used for either cli or nxapi transports. If
       string                                the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD will be used instead.
       port                 Default:         Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device. This value applies to either cli or nxapi. The port value will default to
       integer              "0 (use common   the appropriate transport common port if none is provided in the task. (cli=22, http=80, https=443).
                            port)"
       ssh_keyfile                           Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This argument is only used for the cli transport. If the value is not
       string                                specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE will be used instead.
       timeout              Default:         Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before
       integer              10               the operation is completed, the module will error. NX-API can be slow to return on long-running commands (sh mac, sh bgp, etc).
       transport              Choices:       Configures the transport connection to use when connecting to the remote device. The transport argument supports connectivity to the device over cli
       string / required      • cli ←        (ssh) or nxapi.
                              • nxapi
       use_proxy              Choices:
       boolean                • no           If no, the environment variables http_proxy and https_proxy will be ignored.
       added in 2.5           • yes ←
       use_ssl                Choices:
       boolean                • no ←         Configures the transport to use SSL if set to yes only when the transport=nxapi, otherwise this value is ignored.
                              • yes
       username                              Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate either the CLI login or the nxapi
       string                                authentication depending on which transport is used. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME
                                             will be used instead.
       validate_certs         Choices:       If no, SSL certificates will not be validated. This should only be used on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. If the transport
       boolean                • no           argument is not nxapi, this value is ignored.
                              • yes ←
