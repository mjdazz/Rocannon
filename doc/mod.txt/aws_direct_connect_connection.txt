SYNOPSIS                   *aws_direct_connect_connection*

     • Create, update, or delete a Direct Connect connection between a network and a specific AWS Direct Connect location. Upon creation the connection may be added to a link aggregation group or
       established as a standalone connection. The connection may later be associated or disassociated with a link aggregation group.

NOTES                   *aws_direct_connect_connection-notes*

   Note

     • If parameters are not set within the module, the following environment variables can be used in decreasing order of precedence AWS_URL or EC2_URL, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID or AWS_ACCESS_KEY or
       EC2_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY or AWS_SECRET_KEY or EC2_SECRET_KEY, AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN or EC2_SECURITY_TOKEN, AWS_REGION or EC2_REGION
     • Ansible uses the boto configuration file (typically ~/.boto) if no credentials are provided. See https://boto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/boto_config_tut.html
     • AWS_REGION or EC2_REGION can be typically be used to specify the AWS region, when required, but this can also be configured in the boto config file
