SYNOPSIS                   *gcp_compute_image*

     • Represents an Image resource.
     • Google Compute Engine uses operating system images to create the root persistent disks for your instances. You specify an image when you create an instance. Images contain a boot loader, an
       operating system, and a root file system. Linux operating system images are also capable of running containers on Compute Engine.
     • Images can be either public or custom.
     • Public images are provided and maintained by Google, open-source communities, and third-party vendors. By default, all projects have access to these images and can use them to create
       instances. Custom images are available only to your project. You can create a custom image from root persistent disks and other images. Then, use the custom image to create an instance.

   family                                        The name of the image family to which this image belongs. You can create disks by specifying an image family instead of a specific image name. The
   string                                        image family always returns its latest image that is not deprecated. The name of the image family must comply with RFC1035.

   guest_os_features                             VIRTIO_SCSI_MULTIQUEUE, which allows each virtual CPU to have its own queue. For Windows images, you can only enable VIRTIO_SCSI_MULTIQUEUE on
