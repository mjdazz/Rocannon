SYNOPSIS                   *cnos_user*

     • This module provides declarative management of the local usernames configured on Lenovo CNOS devices. It allows playbooks to manage either individual usernames or the collection of usernames
       in the current running config. It also supports purging usernames from the configuration that are not explicitly defined.

PARAMETERS                   *cnos_user-parameters*

        Parameter      Choices/Defaults                                                                           Comments
   aggregate                            The set of username objects to be configured on the remote Lenovo CNOS device. The list entries can either be the username or a hash of username and
   -                                    properties. This argument is mutually exclusive with the name argument.
                                        aliases: users, collection
   configured_password                  The password to be configured on the network device. The password needs to be provided in cleartext and it will be encrypted on the device. Please note that
   -                                    this option is not same as provider password.
   name                                 The username to be configured on the remote Lenovo CNOS device. This argument accepts a string value and is mutually exclusive with the aggregate argument.
   -
   purge                 Choices:       The purge argument instructs the module to consider the resource definition absolute. It will remove any previously configured usernames on the device with
   boolean               • no ←         the exception of the `admin` user which cannot be deleted per cnos constraints.
                         • yes
   role                                 The role argument configures the role for the username in the device running configuration. The argument accepts a string value defining the role name. This
   -                                    argument does not check if the role has been configured on the device.
                                        aliases: roles
   sshkey                               The sshkey argument defines the SSH public key to configure for the username. This argument accepts a valid SSH key value.
   -
   state                 Choices:       The state argument configures the state of the username definition as it relates to the device operational configuration. When set to present, the
   -                     • present ←    username(s) should be configured in the device active configuration and when set to absent the username(s) should not be in the device active configuration
                         • absent
   update_password       Choices:       Since passwords are encrypted in the device running config, this argument will instruct the module when to change the password. When set to always, the
   -                     • on_create    password will always be updated in the device and when set to on_create the password will be updated only if the username is created.
                         • always ←
