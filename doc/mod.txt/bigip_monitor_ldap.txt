   target_password                       Specifies the password, if the monitored target requires authentication.
   string
   target_username                       Specifies the user name, if the monitored target requires authentication.
   string
                                         Specifies the number of seconds to wait after a resource first responds correctly to the monitor before setting the resource to 'up'.

   integer                               When the interval expires, the resource is marked 'up'.
                                         A value of 0, means that the resource is marked up immediately upon receipt of the first correct response.
                                         Specifies the number of seconds the target has in which to respond to the monitor request.

   integer                               'down'. When this value is set to 0 (zero), the system uses the interval from the parent monitor.
                                         Note that timeout and time_until_up combine to control when a resource is set to up.
   up_interval                           Specifies the interval for the system to use to perform the health check when a resource is up.
   integer                               When 0, specifies that the system uses the interval specified in interval to check the health of the resource.
                                         When any other number, enables specification of a different interval to use when checking the health of a resource that is up.
   update_password        Choices:       always will update passwords if the target_password is specified.
   string                 • always ←     on_create will only set the password for newly created monitors.
                          • on_create

NOTES                   *bigip_monitor_ldap-notes*

   Note

     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
