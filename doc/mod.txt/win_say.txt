       target(s) for the speech to be audible.

   speech_speed     Default:         How fast or slow to speak the text.
   integer          0                Must be an integer value in the range -10 to 10.
                                     -10 is slowest, 10 is fastest.

   voice                             Which voice to use. See notes for how to discover installed voices.
   string                            If the requested voice is not available the default voice will be used. Example voice names from Windows 10 are Microsoft Zira Desktop and Microsoft Hazel
                                     Desktop.

NOTES                   *win_say-notes*

   Note

     • Needs speakers or headphones to do anything useful.

     • To find which voices are installed, run the following Powershell commands.

         Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Speech $speech = New-Object -TypeName System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer $speech.GetInstalledVoices() | ForEach-Object { $_.VoiceInfo }
         $speech.Dispose()

     • Speech can be surprisingly slow, so it’s best to keep message text short.
