   force        Choices:

   name
   - /                                            Name of the plugin to install.
   required
   plugin_bin                                     Location of the plugin binary. If this file is not found, the default plugin binaries will be used.
   -                                              The default changed in Ansible 2.4 to None.
   plugin_dir Default:                            Your configured plugin directory specified in Elasticsearch
   -          "/usr/share/elasticsearch/plugins/"
   proxy_host                                     Proxy host to use during plugin installation
   -
   proxy_port                                     Proxy port to use during plugin installation
   -
                                                  Optionally set the source location to retrieve the plugin from. This can be a file:// URL to install from a local file, or a remote URL. If this is
   src                                            not set, the plugin location is just based on the name.
   -                                              The name parameter must match the descriptor in the plugin ZIP specified.
   added in                                       Is only used if the state would change, which is solely checked based on the name parameter. If, for example, the plugin is already installed,
   2.7                                            changing this has no effect.
                                                  For ES 1.x use url.
   state        Choices:
   -            • present ←                       Desired state of a plugin.
                • absent
   timeout    Default:                            Timeout setting: 30s, 1m, 1h...
   -          "1m"                                Only valid for Elasticsearch < 5.0. This option is ignored for Elasticsearch > 5.0.
   url                                            Set exact URL to download the plugin from (Only works for ES 1.x).
   -                                              For ES 2.x and higher, use src.
   version                                        Version of the plugin to be installed. If plugin exists with previous version, it will NOT be updated
