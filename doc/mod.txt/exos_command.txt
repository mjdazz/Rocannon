SYNOPSIS                   *exos_command*

     • Sends arbitrary commands to an Extreme EXOS device and returns the results read from the device. This module includes an argument that will cause the module to wait for a specific condition
       before returning or timing out if the condition is not met.
     • This module does not support running configuration commands. Please use exos_config to configure EXOS devices.

PARAMETERS                   *exos_command-parameters*

   Parameter Choices/Defaults                                                                                Comments
   commands                   List of commands to send to the remote EXOS device over the configured provider. The resulting output from the command is returned. If the wait_for argument is
   - /                        provided, the module is not returned until the condition is satisfied or the number of retries has expired.
   required
   interval  Default:         Configures the interval in seconds to wait between retries of the command. If the command does not pass the specified conditions, the interval indicates how long to
   -         1                wait before trying the command again.
   match       Choices:       The match argument is used in conjunction with the wait_for argument to specify the match policy. Valid values are all or any. If the value is set to all then all
   -           • any          conditionals in the wait_for must be satisfied. If the value is set to any then only one of the values must be satisfied.
               • all ←
   retries   Default:         Specifies the number of retries a command should by tried before it is considered failed. The command is run on the target device every retry and evaluated against the
   -         10               wait_for conditions.
   wait_for                   List of conditions to evaluate against the output of the command. The task will wait for each condition to be true before moving forward. If the conditional is not
   -                          true within the configured number of retries, the task fails. See examples.

NOTES                   *exos_command-notes*

   Note

     • If a command sent to the device requires answering a prompt, it is possible to pass a dict containing command, answer and prompt. See examples.
