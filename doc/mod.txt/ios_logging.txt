    auth_pass                     Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device. If authorize is false, then this argument does nothing. If the value is
    string                        not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS will be used instead.

    required
    password                      Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not

    path                          value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE will be used instead.
    timeout     Default:          Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands. If the timeout is exceeded before the
    integer     10                operation is completed, the module will error.
    username                      Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not
    string                        specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will be used instead.
