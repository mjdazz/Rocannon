SYNOPSIS                   *bigip_device_connectivity*

     • Manages device IP configuration settings for HA on a BIG-IP. Each BIG-IP device has synchronization and failover connectivity information (IP addresses) that you define as part of HA pairing
       or clustering. This module allows you to configure that information.

NOTES                   *bigip_device_connectivity-notes*

   Note

     • This module is primarily used as a component of configuring HA pairs of BIG-IP devices.
     • Requires BIG-IP >= 12.0.0
     • For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
     • Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
     • The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the
       bigip_config module to save the running configuration. Refer to the module’s documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
