RETURN VALUES                   *gcp_compute_target_https_proxy_info-return values*

   Common return values are documented here, the following are the fields unique to this module:

           Key         Returned                                                                              Description
   resources           always   List of resources
   complex
     creationTimestamp success  Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
     string
     description       success  An optional description of this resource.
     string
     id                success  The unique identifier for the resource.
     integer
     name                       Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name
     string            success  must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]"[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all
                                following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.

     string            success  of NONE, ENABLE, or DISABLE. If NONE is specified, uses the QUIC policy with no user overrides, which is equivalent to DISABLE. Not specifying this field is
                                equivalent to specifying NONE.
     sslCertificates   success  A list of SslCertificate resources that are used to authenticate connections between users and the load balancer. Currently, exactly one SSL certificate must be
     list                       specified.
     sslPolicy         success  A reference to the SslPolicy resource that will be associated with the TargetHttpsProxy resource. If not set, the TargetHttpsProxy resource will not have any SSL
     dictionary                 policy configured.
