   string
   env_type                                    Specifies which Ansible environment you're running this module within.
   string                                      This should not be set unless you know what you're doing.

   name                                        Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
   string / required                           Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]"[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must
                                               be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.

   string
   quic_override                               Specifies the QUIC override policy for this resource. This determines whether the load balancer will attempt to negotiate QUIC with clients or not.
   string                                      Can specify one of NONE, ENABLE, or DISABLE. If NONE is specified, uses the QUIC policy with no user overrides, which is equivalent to DISABLE. Not
   added in 2.7                                specifying this field is equivalent to specifying NONE.
                                               Some valid choices include: "NONE", "ENABLE", "DISABLE"

   ssl_policy                                  have any SSL policy configured.
   dictionary                                  This field represents a link to a SslPolicy resource in GCP. It can be specified in two ways. First, you can place a dictionary with key 'selfLink'
   added in 2.8                                and value of your resource's selfLink Alternatively, you can add `register: name-of-resource` to a gcp_compute_ssl_policy task and then set this

                                               A reference to the UrlMap resource that defines the mapping from URL to the BackendService.
   url_map                                     This field represents a link to a UrlMap resource in GCP. It can be specified in two ways. First, you can place a dictionary with key 'selfLink' and
   dictionary / required                       value of your resource's selfLink Alternatively, you can add `register: name-of-resource` to a gcp_compute_url_map task and then set this url_map
