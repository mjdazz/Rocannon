SYNOPSIS                   *service*

     • Controls services on remote hosts. Supported init systems include BSD init, OpenRC, SysV, Solaris SMF, systemd, upstart.
     • For Windows targets, use the win_service module instead.

PARAMETERS                   *service-parameters*

   Parameter Choices/Defaults                                                                                Comments
   arguments                  Additional arguments provided on the command line.
   string                     aliases: args
   enabled     Choices:       Whether the service should start on boot.
   boolean     • no           At least one of state and enabled are required.
               • yes
   name
   string /                   Name of the service.
   required
   pattern                    If the service does not respond to the status command, name a substring to look for as would be found in the output of the ps command as a stand-in for a status
   string                     result.
                              If the string is found, the service will be assumed to be started.
   runlevel  Default:         For OpenRC init scripts (e.g. Gentoo) only.
   string    "default"        The runlevel that this service belongs to.
   sleep                      If the service is being restarted then sleep this many seconds between the stop and start command.
   integer                    This helps to work around badly-behaving init scripts that exit immediately after signaling a process to stop.
                              Not all service managers support sleep, i.e when using systemd this setting will be ignored.
               Choices:       started/stopped are idempotent actions that will not run commands unless necessary.
   state       • reloaded     restarted will always bounce the service.
   string      • restarted    reloaded will always reload.
               • started      At least one of state and enabled are required.
               • stopped      Note that reloaded will start the service if it is not already started, even if your chosen init system wouldn't normally.
   use       Default:         The service module actually uses system specific modules, normally through auto detection, this setting can force a specific module.
   string    "auto"           Normally it uses the value of the 'ansible_service_mgr' fact and falls back to the old 'service' module when none matching is found.

NOTES                   *service-notes*

     • For AIX, group subsystem names can be used.
