SYNOPSIS                   *memset_dns_reload*

     • Request a reload of Memset’s DNS infrastructure, and optionally poll until it finishes.

PARAMETERS                   *memset_dns_reload-parameters*

   Parameter Choices/Defaults                                                                                Comments
   api_key
   - /                        The API key obtained from the Memset control panel.
   required
   poll        Choices:       Boolean value, if set will poll the reload job's status and return when the job has completed (unless the 30 second timeout is reached first). If the timeout is
   boolean     • no ←         reached then the task will not be marked as failed, but stderr will indicate that the polling failed.
               • yes

NOTES                   *memset_dns_reload-notes*

   Note

     • DNS reload requests are a best-effort service provided by Memset; these generally happen every 15 minutes by default, however you can request an immediate reload if later tasks rely on the
       records being created. An API key generated via the Memset customer control panel is required with the following minimum scope - dns.reload. If you wish to poll the job status to wait until
       the reload has completed, then job.status is also required.
